// maxConcurrentForeground (#253) — a second, independent concurrency pool for
// agents a caller is blocking on inline (`spawnAndWait`).
//
// pi dispatches a message's tool calls through `Promise.all`, so N blocking
// `Agent` calls in one message have always started at once. This pool bounds
// that. It is OFF by default, and the first test in this file is what keeps it
// off: it fails the moment the default path grows an await, a counter or a
// queue entry.
//
// The hangs are the dangerous failures here, not the assertion failures: a
// queued record has no promise to await, and pi has no tool-execution timeout
// anywhere, so a release() that never fires waits forever. Every test that
// exercises a path out of the queue therefore asserts the waiter RESOLVES.
