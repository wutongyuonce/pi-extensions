# pi-workflow bundled workflows

These are the official bundled `/workflow` starters shipped with pi-workflow. A workflow defines structure and role prompts; the concrete task is supplied at runtime.

Run them from the project root by exact workflow name, for example:

```text
/workflow list
/workflow show deep-research
/workflow validate deep-research
/workflow run deep-research "Research the current project architecture and verify the key claims. Use max depth."
```

For spec-less direct dynamic execution, use `/workflow dynamic "<task>"`; it does not select one of the bundled workflow specs below.

## Official bundled workflows

| Workflow | Required agents | Use when |
|---|---|---|
| `deep-research` | `researcher` | Use when you need a grounded answer or summary based on source material. |
| `deep-review` | `scout` | Use when you want code or design reviewed carefully from multiple angles. |
| `spec-review` | `scout` | Use when you want to check whether requirements, an API spec, or a contract are reflected in the implementation and tests. |
| `impact-review` | `scout` | Use before merging or releasing a change to check affected areas, risks, missing tests, and missing docs. |

`deep-research` declares `low`, `medium`, and `high` execution profiles and explicitly defaults to `medium`. Interactive launches offer those profiles plus the base spec; headless omission uses the declared default. `low` is an explicit faster/cheaper quality trade-off, `low` and `medium` use profile-only max-2 batching for compatible `verify-claims` items, and `high` spends more reasoning while retaining singleton verification. Pass `--profile <name>` to bypass the prompt. Profile names are workflow-defined rather than reserved; see `docs/usage.md` for the optional profile schema and fallback guarantees.

Every official bundled workflow ends with the same user-facing completion envelope: a compact `completionSummaryMarkdown`, a workflow-specific `final-report.md` whose first detailed section is **Executive summary**, explicit evidence/limitations, and a final **Related artifacts** appendix. The deterministic renderer keeps each workflow's own authority model rather than forcing research verdicts onto review/readiness outputs. `deep-research` retains byte-identical `executive.md` plus claim-level `audit.md`; `deep-review` retains byte-identical `review.md`; `spec-review` and `impact-review` write `source-ledger.json`. Missing, partial, contradictory, or incompletely represented canonical inputs fail or block the final renderer instead of producing a clean completion.

Deep-research synthesis stays anchored to the runtime task and writes parent-facing text in that task's language unless another language is requested. Its report body preserves research scope/method, detailed findings, recommendations, action plan, evidence strength, gaps, sources, and audit totals. Deep-review uses finding dispositions and severity; each reviewer must account for every planned evidence path byte-for-byte as `read`, `ocr-extracted`, `metadata-only`, or `unreadable`. The deterministic reducer verifies `read` quotes against the planned file/range using a bounded descriptor read. OCR quotes require a current-user-owned, single-link, non-writable artifact under the non-symlinked `.pi/ocr-artifacts/` control-plane root plus an exact `<artifact>.binding.json` manifest that binds source path/digest and artifact path/digest. Missing, unverifiable, duplicate, or unusable required content forces `PARTIAL_REVIEW`, quarantines findings from that incomplete reviewer to `NEEDS_HUMAN`, makes the final render gate fail closed, and remains listed in the report. Singleton verifier evidence for every KEEP/WEAKEN/DROP disposition is likewise structured and checked against its exact repository file/range before partitioning. Spec-review uses conformance and requirement coverage; impact-review uses contract, regression-risk, and ship-readiness joins.

Experimental or candidate workflows should live outside the bundled `workflows/` directory until their task fit is validated. Historical workflow-specific batched verification/devil-advocate path-ref variants remain internalized and are not shipped. The public runtime now supports profile-only transparent max-2 batching for eligible `foreach` stages, while generic orchestration primitives such as `foreach`, `matrix`, `fanout`, and multi-query web-source calls remain available where documented.

Bundled workflows that verify source-backed claims can share the verification outcome ontology exported by the package: `verified`, `partially_supported`, `unsupported`, `conflicting`, and `verification_blocked`. Workflow helpers should keep dependency-free bundle-local shims in parity with that package export, because helper imports are bundled from the workflow spec directory. `verification_blocked` means verification could not complete because evidence, tool, source-access, or policy conditions blocked evaluation; it is never counted as verified. Deep-research adopts this ontology now. Workflows with different verdict models, such as finding disposition or ship readiness, should not be forced into it. Deep-diff-review revival is intentionally out of scope for this ontology update.

## Bundle layout

Bundled workflows use directory-local bundles:

```text
workflows/name/
  spec.json
  schemas/
    stage-control.schema.json
  helpers/
    support-helper.mjs
```

Bundle names resolve from the directory name (`/workflow run name ...`). Name priority is project-shared `<cwd>/workflows/`, then project-private `<cwd>/.pi/workflows/`, then user/global `~/.pi/agent/workflows/`, then this bundled package root. A higher-priority match shadows lower roots. Multiple matching forms at the winning priority fail closed as ambiguous.

`output.controlSchema` in a bundle is resolved relative to the workflow spec file, for example `./schemas/final-control.schema.json`.

## DAG authoring

Artifact-graph workflows use `from` for data edges, `after` for order-only edges, and `type: "dag"` containers for nested sibling-scoped graphs. A downstream stage consumes a container with `from: "analysis"`, which resolves to the container's `outputFrom` child. See `docs/usage.md` for the full DAG example, artifact bundle rules, and validation rules.

## Support helpers and web tools

Support nodes run bundle-local `.mjs` helper code inline instead of launching a subagent (deep-research uses them to compact normalize inputs and preserve audited verdict/sourceRef ledgers). Bundled workflows prefer the normalized web-source tools (`workflow_web_search`, `workflow_web_fetch_source`, `workflow_web_source_read`) over legacy web tools.

Legacy `fetch_content` workflow tasks use a run-scoped cache and a configurable inline text cap to reduce worker context pressure.

See `docs/usage.md` for the support helper API and path-containment rules ("Support helpers") and for web tool semantics, batching, cache layout, and the `fetch_content` security policy ("Run-scoped web-source cache" and "Web tools").
