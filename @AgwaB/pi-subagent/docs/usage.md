# pi-subagent Usage

Detailed usage reference for the public Pi tool **`subagent`**.

## Install

```bash
pi install npm:@agwab/pi-subagent
```

Reload Pi after installation.

Requires Node.js `>=22.19.0`.

## Tool surface

Tool name:

```text
subagent
```

TUI command:

```text
/subagent panel
```

## Actions

Every call has an `action`. The default is `run`, so omitting `action` starts a new subagent.

| `action` | Purpose | Key parameters |
|---|---|---|
| `run` (default) | Start a new subagent run, or launch independent runs in parallel. | `agent`/`task` or `tasks`; plus `sandbox`, `worktree`, `model`, `async`, etc. |
| `status` | Read a run's current state. | `runId`, optional `cwd`, `attemptId` |
| `logs` | Read a run's captured logs. | `runId`, optional `cwd`, `attemptId` |
| `wait` | Block until a run finishes. | `runId`, optional `cwd`, `timeoutMs`, `pollIntervalMs` |
| `interrupt` | Signal a process-backed run. | `runId`, optional `cwd`, `attemptId`, `signal`, `escalateAfterMs`, `killAfterMs`, `reason` |
| `mark-background` | Mark a run as not needed before the final answer. | `runId`, optional `cwd` |
| `reconcile` | Re-read durable artifacts and repair stale/orphaned state when possible. | `runId`, optional `cwd` |
| `prune` | Delete old terminal runs under `<cwd>/<runsDir>`. Dry run unless `yes` is true. | optional `cwd`, `runsDir`, `keep` (default 50), `olderThanDays`, `yes` |

State is file-based under `.pi/agent/runs/<run-id>/`. `status`/`logs`/`wait` read those files; `interrupt` sends a real OS signal; `mark-background` updates run metadata; `reconcile` repairs local metadata from durable attempt artifacts without relaunching work. Nothing deletes run directories automatically: `prune` (also `/subagent prune [--yes] [--keep N] [--older-than DAYS]` from the prompt, or `pruneSubagentRuns` from the code API) keeps the newest `keep` fully terminal runs, optionally restricted to runs older than `olderThanDays`, reports the selection with byte counts, and deletes only when `yes` is true. Runs with a non-terminal run, attempt, or task status are skipped even when stale (`reconcile` them first), unreadable or malformed run records are skipped, ordering and `olderThanDays` use the record's `updatedAt`, and a deleted run's global locator is removed only when it points at the same cwd and runs dir. Deletion is fenced: the runs directory must resolve (after symlinks) inside the cwd, symlinked entries are never followed, and each run is re-validated under its run lock (with an exact `updatedAt` generation check) and renamed away before removal, with the lock held through locator cleanup, so a concurrent mutation is never partially deleted: it waits and then either fails or, via `beginRunRecord`, starts a fresh record strictly after the deletion completed. Recent runs also write a global locator pointer, so existing-run actions can often resolve a `runId` even when `cwd` is omitted or the run was launched from another cwd.

Cancellation kinds: `interrupt` on an async (durable-worker) run records `failureKind: "user_cancelled"` whether the interrupt lands before or during model execution. `abort` means the caller dropped its own tool call (the parent `AbortSignal` fired), and `cancelled` means the child process died from an external signal that no interrupt or abort requested.

`reconcileSubagentRun()` returns `status:"running"` only when current liveness evidence says the run may still be executing. If verified cleanup cannot complete safely, it returns `status:"cleanup-blocked"` with a stable `cleanupBlocked.reason` and the affected attempt IDs; callers should surface that state rather than treating it as ordinary execution. Process ownership uses Linux boot ID plus kernel start ticks, or a bundled macOS `proc_pidinfo` helper with microsecond process start time. Missing or unverifiable platform identity fails closed and is never signal authority.

Attempt-scoped supervisors should pass `expectedAttemptId` to `reconcileSubagentRun()`. If another attempt has become active/latest, reconciliation returns `status:"superseded"` before cleanup or registry mutation. This prevents a delayed finalizer from stale-terminalizing its successor.

Parent orchestrators may record descendant state with `recordSubagentChildEvent`, which appends `child.*` events to the parent run's `events.jsonl` (`child.started`, `child.failed`, `child.completed`, or `child.cancelled`). Event data may include `childRunId` (or legacy aliases `childId` / `descendantRunId`), `workflowRunId`, `taskId`, and `failureKind`. `status` and `/subagent panel` aggregate those into `childSummary`, including failure counts, active child run IDs, and the latest currently failed/cancelled child. This keeps parent status distinct from descendant failures and makes retry attempts distinguishable from newly-started child work.

Model:

```text
run = one subagent execution
attempt = one launch attempt
child = descendant work reported by an orchestrator through child.* events
correlationId = optional external trace label
```

`taskId` remains accepted as a deprecated read alias for older artifacts.

## Calling the tool

The examples below show `subagent` argument objects. Pi usually builds these from natural-language requests; extensions or tests can pass the same object as `params` to the registered tool's `execute` function.

## Code API

Orchestrators can import the runtime directly from the `./api` subpath:

```ts
import {
  runSubagent,
  getSubagentStatus,
  getSubagentLogs,
  waitForSubagent,
  interruptSubagent,
  reconcileSubagentRun,
  recordSubagentChildEvent,
  pruneSubagentRuns,
  formatPruneSubagentRunsSummary,
} from "@agwab/pi-subagent/api";

const run = await runSubagent({
  cwd: process.cwd(),
  agent: "reviewer",
  task: "Review the current diff.",
  async: true,
  onComplete: "detach",
});

const status = await getSubagentStatus({ cwd: process.cwd(), runId: run.runId });
const logs = await getSubagentLogs({ cwd: process.cwd(), runId: run.runId });
await waitForSubagent({ cwd: process.cwd(), runId: run.runId, timeoutMs: 300000 });
await interruptSubagent({ cwd: process.cwd(), runId: run.runId, reason: "caller cancelled" });
await reconcileSubagentRun({ cwd: process.cwd(), runId: run.runId });
const prune = await pruneSubagentRuns({ cwd: process.cwd(), keep: 50, olderThanDays: 30 }); // dry run
console.log(formatPruneSubagentRunsSummary(prune));
await pruneSubagentRuns({ cwd: process.cwd(), keep: 50, olderThanDays: 30, yes: true });
await recordSubagentChildEvent({
  cwd: process.cwd(),
  runId: run.runId,
  event: "failed",
  childRunId: "run_child_123",
  childTaskId: "task-4",
  failureKind: "model",
});
```

`runSubagent` accepts the same run options as the tool, plus an optional `signal`. Existing-run helpers accept `runId`, optional `cwd`, optional `attemptId`, and optional `runsDir`; when `cwd` is omitted they use the global locator index first and fall back to the current cwd for legacy records. The API is intentionally object-only and does not expose the lower-level runner internals.

The code API is ESM-only. Import `@agwab/pi-subagent/api`; do not deep-import internal files such as `src/orchestrate/*` because only documented package subpaths are public. Every export is listed with its signature in [`api.md`](./api.md).

### General durable launch barrier

Code API orchestrators that need release-versus-cancellation ordering should use
the v2 barrier. Release and revocation compete for one immutable, owner-only,
fsynced decision file, so exactly one outcome can authorize the worker:

```ts
import {
  createDurableLaunchBarrierV2,
  durableLaunchBarrierDigest,
  resolveDurableLaunchBarrierV2Release,
  revokeDurableLaunchBarrierV2,
  runSubagent,
  waitForDurableLaunchBarrierV2Ack,
  waitForDurableLaunchBarrierV2Ready,
} from "@agwab/pi-subagent/api";

const barrier = await createDurableLaunchBarrierV2({
  directory: "/absolute/private/path/attempt-barrier",
  subjectSha256: durableLaunchBarrierDigest({ operation: "my-operation" }),
  // Optional caller-verified authority binding. pi-subagent binds this digest
  // but does not interpret or grant the underlying authority.
  authorityBindingSha256: durableLaunchBarrierDigest({ grantId: "grant-123" }),
});
const run = await runSubagent({
  cwd: process.cwd(),
  backend: "headless",
  task: "Perform the bounded operation.",
  async: true,
  onComplete: "detach",
  durableLaunchBarrier: barrier,
});
const ready = await waitForDurableLaunchBarrierV2Ready(barrier);

// Persist and crash-durably sync caller authorization/accounting first.
const decision = await resolveDurableLaunchBarrierV2Release(
  barrier,
  ready,
  durableLaunchBarrierDigest({ authorityState: "consumed" }),
);
if (decision.outcome === "released") {
  await waitForDurableLaunchBarrierV2Ack(barrier, decision.decision);
}

// A cancellation path instead calls revokeDurableLaunchBarrierV2(). If release
// already won, it returns outcome "released" rather than rewriting history.
await revokeDurableLaunchBarrierV2(barrier, {
  cancellationId: "stable-attempt-cancellation-id",
  reasonSha256: durableLaunchBarrierDigest({ reason: "caller stopped" }),
});
```

Before READY, the worker resolves backend, agent/tool authority, workspace, and
effective execution cwd into an immutable execution plan. READY binds that plan.
A v2 worker waits for `decision-v2.json`: `revoked` terminates as
`user_cancelled` without entering prepared model/provider execution; `released`
binds the exact run, attempt, READY, authority, and release payload. The worker
writes an ACK, revalidates the immutable decision, and checks its abort signal
again immediately before executing the prepared plan. Matching writes and reads
are idempotently recoverable after partial filesystem commits. Timeout,
path/identity drift, conflicting replay, or malformed records fail closed.

The original v1 exports remain available for compatibility, but v1 has no shared
release-or-revoke linearization object and must not be used to claim that a
concurrent cancellation can prevent release. The barrier is a code-API primitive;
the public `subagent` model tool does not expose it. `correlationId` and `runsDir`
remain optional, parallel children require distinct barriers, and durable binding
requires process-isolated `headless` or `tmux` execution. Barrier path protection
assumes same-UID local processes are trusted; pathname checks do not defend against
a malicious same-UID process that swaps a directory away and restores it between
checks.

Project-local agents are repository-controlled. Project-local agent confirmation is disabled by default; use trusted repositories or constrain lookup with `agentScope:"global"`. The code API has no interactive prompt, so setting `confirmProjectAgents:true` rejects project-local agents instead of prompting.

## Single run

```json
{
  "agent": "reviewer",
  "task": "Review the current diff and summarize the highest-risk issues."
}
```

## Parallel fan-out

```json
{
  "tasks": [
    { "agent": "reviewer-security", "task": "Security review." },
    { "agent": "reviewer-performance", "task": "Performance review." },
    { "agent": "reviewer-test-coverage", "task": "Test coverage review." }
  ]
}
```

Parallel launches are independent runs started concurrently. The response contains `runIds` and per-run results; there is no aggregate run, aggregate task, dependency scheduling, or fan-in status.

Parallel runs use the shared checkout by default, matching single runs and allowing fan-out in non-git workspaces. Parallel fan-out is therefore safest for read-only review/analysis tasks. If parallel tasks will mutate files, request isolation explicitly with `worktree:true`, `workspace:"worktree"`, or `worktreePolicy:"required"`; shared-checkout mutation is not rejected automatically.

Use `concurrency` to cap parallel fan-out:

```json
{
  "concurrency": 2,
  "tasks": [
    { "agent": "reviewer-security", "task": "Security review." },
    { "agent": "reviewer-performance", "task": "Performance review." }
  ]
}
```

For synchronous parallel fan-out, `failFast:true` stops scheduling additional siblings after the first failed result. Add `cancelSiblingsOnFailure:true` to also abort siblings that are already running:

```json
{
  "failFast": true,
  "cancelSiblingsOnFailure": true,
  "tasks": [
    { "task": "Run check A." },
    { "task": "Run check B." }
  ]
}
```

The parallel response includes `totalTasks`, `startedCount`, `skippedCount`, and `failFastTriggered` so callers can distinguish skipped siblings from completed/failed runs. Async parallel launches return once children are started, so fail-fast decisions for later runtime failures must be handled by the parent/workflow layer.

Chain/sequential execution is intentionally not supported by this engine. If step B needs output from step A, keep that sequencing in the parent agent or a workflow layer.

## Async and existing runs

Start a detached run by calling `subagent` with `async: true`, `onComplete: "detach"`, or `onComplete: "notify"`:

```json
{
  "agent": "reviewer",
  "task": "Audit the repository and write a concise risk report.",
  "async": true,
  "asyncDependency": "needed-before-final"
}
```

`asyncDependency` can be `needed-before-final`, `background`, or `unclassified`. `onComplete` can be `return`, `detach`, or `notify`. `notify` sends an internal Pi notification/update when the run completes; it does not call external webhooks.

Check status with another `subagent` tool call:

```json
{ "action": "status", "runId": "run_..." }
```

Read logs:

```json
{ "action": "logs", "runId": "run_..." }
```

Wait for completion:

```json
{ "action": "wait", "runId": "run_...", "timeoutMs": 300000 }
```

`wait` reports the wait operation status, not run success. `status:"completed"` with `outcome:"terminal"` means the target run reached any terminal state; inspect `snapshot.status` to distinguish `completed`, `failed`, and `cancelled` runs.

Mark a run as background metadata:

```json
{ "action": "mark-background", "runId": "run_..." }
```

Interrupt a process-backed run:

```json
{ "action": "interrupt", "runId": "run_..." }
```

`interrupt` is conservative. It can signal runs with registered process metadata. Unsupported or already-terminal runs return explicit status rather than pretending cancellation succeeded. The default signal is `SIGTERM`, which a headless Pi child treats as a graceful stop (it aborts the running tool, terminates the tool's subprocesses, and exits); `SIGINT` makes Pi exit immediately and can leave tool subprocesses such as a running shell command behind, so pass it only when you want that. If the run is still active after `escalateAfterMs` (1 s) the signal is re-sent as `SIGTERM`, and after `killAfterMs` (3 s) as `SIGKILL`.

### Existing-run resolution

For `status`, `logs`, `wait`, `interrupt`, `mark-background`, and `reconcile`, the lookup order is:

1. Use the explicit `cwd`/`runsDir` when provided.
2. Otherwise, check the current cwd's `.pi/agent/runs` for legacy/local records.
3. Otherwise, resolve `runId` through the global locator index and read the pointed-to run directory.

The locator index is only a pointer for finding runs across cwd boundaries. `run.json`, `events.jsonl`, and attempt `result.json` files remain the source of truth. Malformed or oversized locator files older than the locator-prune threshold are removed during index reads; the default threshold is 30 days and can be tuned with `PI_SUBAGENT_RUN_LOCATOR_PRUNE_AFTER_MS` (`-1` disables pruning). The panel also prunes old missing-directory locators after session/cwd pre-filtering so global scans do not touch every run directory unnecessarily.

## Common run options

| Option | Use |
|---|---|
| `cwd` | Run from a specific project directory. Existing-run actions accept `cwd` to force a registry location; if omitted, recent runs can be found by global locator and older runs fall back to the current cwd. |
| `timeoutMs` | Limit worker execution time for `run`; limit polling duration for `action: "wait"`. Omit it for no runtime kill deadline; `wait` alone defaults to 60s polling. |
| `visible` | Use a visible tmux-backed worker (`visible: true`). |
| `concurrency` | Cap parallel run fan-out. |
| `failFast` | For synchronous parallel runs, stop scheduling new siblings after the first failed result. |
| `cancelSiblingsOnFailure` | For synchronous parallel runs, abort already-running siblings after the first failed result; implies fail-fast scheduling. |
| `model` | Select a Pi model/provider for model-backed workers. |
| `thinking` / `thinkingLevel` / `reasoningLevel` | Set the reasoning level. |
| `tools` | Tool allowlist. With a named agent this may only narrow agent-declared tools; it cannot expand authority. For agentless runs it sets the full tool allowlist. |
| `roleContext` | Add one-off role instructions without creating an agent file. |
| `agentScope` | Restrict agent lookup to `auto`, `global`, or `project`. |
| `confirmProjectAgents` | Defaults to `false`. Set `true` to require project-agent confirmation in interactive tool calls; code API calls with `true` reject project-local agents because they cannot prompt. |
| `systemPrompt` | Full system prompt override. When provided, it wins over any agent file prompt; named-agent frontmatter such as `tools`, `model`, and `thinking` may still apply. |
| `skills` | Additional Pi skill paths to load in the child. Omit to use normal ambient discovery; pass `[]` to disable child skills. |
| `extensions` | Additional Pi extension paths to load in the child. Omit to use normal ambient discovery; pass `[]` to disable child extensions. |
| `runsDir` | Safe relative artifact root under `cwd`; default `.pi/agent/runs`. |
| `correlationId` | Optional external trace label, e.g. a workflow run id. It has no scheduling or aggregation semantics. |
| `captureToolCalls` | Optional redacted debug telemetry for child tool calls. Defaults to `false`; when `true`, supported live event backends write completed tool call summaries as artifacts without full args/results or update streams. |
| `toolResultBudget` | Opt-in transcript hygiene for headless children (code API): `{ maxTotalChars }` caps cumulative retained tool-result characters. When a new tool result would exceed the budget, the oldest retained results are replaced with `[evicted tool result: <tool>, <n> chars]` placeholders (the newest result is never evicted); eviction counts land in `metadata.toolResultBudget`. On a context-length failure with at least one evictable result, the run evicts the oldest ~25% of retained tool-result chars and retries once (`metadata.contextRecovered`). Invalid values are ignored with a recorded warning. Default off; behavior without the option is unchanged. |

## Sandbox

```json
{
  "sandbox": true,
  "agent": "checker",
  "task": "Run a local check and report the artifact paths."
}
```

Rules:

- `sandbox: true` enables sandboxing with **no network access** (deny-all). `false`, `null`, or omission disables sandboxing.
- `sandbox: { allowedDomains: [...] }` enables sandboxing with explicit network egress.
- Process-backed workers (`headless`, `tmux`) can be sandboxed.
- `inline + sandbox` fails validation because an in-process SDK worker cannot provide per-worker OS sandboxing.
- The public API intentionally does not expose sandbox engine selection yet.

### Sandbox network policy

The whole child Pi process runs inside the sandbox boundary, so the model API call itself needs network access. A sandboxed model-backed run must therefore allow its provider endpoint explicitly:

```json
{
  "sandbox": { "allowedDomains": ["api.anthropic.com"] },
  "agent": "implementer",
  "task": "Make the requested local change and run the checks."
}
```

Rules:

- Domains are bare hostnames (`api.anthropic.com`) or `*.example.com`-style wildcards. Protocols, paths, ports, and broad wildcards such as `*.com` are rejected.
- `deniedDomains` is not exposed; the policy is allow-only.
- `sandbox: true` keeps deny-all network. Use it for offline work: running local checks, formatting, builds against vendored dependencies.
- The effective `allowedDomains` are recorded in the result envelope (`result.sandbox.allowedDomains`) for audit.

Guidance:

- The caller decides per run, following least privilege: list the model provider endpoint the child will use, plus any extra domains the task itself needs (for example `github.com` or `*.npmjs.org` for installs).
- Do not sandbox open-ended research tasks; the domains they need cannot be enumerated in advance, and headless workers cannot prompt for approval. Use an unsandboxed worker with worktree isolation instead (filesystem safety without network limits).

## Workspaces and worktrees

There are three inputs for worktree isolation, in order of preference:

| Input | When to use |
|---|---|
| `worktree` | Primary switch. `true` to isolate; or a string path for an explicit worktree location. |
| `workspace` | Advanced. `"shared" \| "worktree" \| "auto"`, or `{ mode, path }` for an explicit path. |
| `worktreePolicy` | Advanced. `"auto" \| "required" \| "never"` to force or forbid isolation. |

Most calls only need `worktree`:

```json
{
  "worktree": true,
  "agent": "implementer",
  "task": "Make the requested local change in an isolated worktree."
}
```

Advanced forms:

```json
{ "workspace": "worktree" }
{ "workspace": { "mode": "worktree", "path": ".pi-subagent-worktrees/task-a" } }
{ "worktreePolicy": "required" }
```

The default workspace is `shared` for both single and parallel runs, so fanout works in any directory, including non-git workspaces. Parallel fanout is usually read-only (reviews, analysis); when parallel tasks mutate files, request worktree isolation explicitly so tasks do not write into the same checkout concurrently.

Explicit isolation requests (`worktree: true`, `workspace: "worktree"`, `worktreePolicy: "required"`) are never silently downgraded: in a non-git cwd they fail with a validation error instead of falling back to shared. Note that shared-workspace runs do not produce `worktree-status`/`worktree-diff` artifacts, so mutating tasks lose change-evidence capture without worktree isolation.

Worktree cleanup is managed:

```text
completed -> capture status/diff artifacts, then remove the worktree
failed/cancelled -> capture status/diff artifacts, keep the worktree for debugging
```

Worktree evidence is recorded in `result.json` under `workspace.worktreeCleanupStatus`, `workspace.worktreeStatusPath`, and `workspace.worktreeDiffPath`. The status/diff artifacts cover tracked and untracked changes but exclude Pi runtime state the child session writes inside the worktree (`.pi/agent/runs/**`, `.pi/workflows/index.json`, `.pi/workflows/index.lock`); other files under `.pi/` are reported like any other change.

Kept worktrees (from failed or cancelled runs) live in `.pi-subagent-worktrees/` **next to** the repository root, not inside it, and are never pruned automatically. To clean up after debugging:

```bash
git worktree list                      # inspect registered worktrees
rm -rf ../.pi-subagent-worktrees/<dir> # remove the kept checkout
git worktree prune                     # clear stale registrations
```

## Backend selection

Backend is optional. When omitted, the engine uses auto-selection:

| Input condition | Resolved backend |
|---|---|
| `visible: true` | `tmux` |
| `sandbox: true` | `headless`, unless tmux/visible is explicit |
| worktree isolation requested (`worktree`, `workspace: "worktree"`, `worktreePolicy: "required"`, or `workspace: "auto"` with a sandbox) | `headless` |
| effective cwd (the `cwd` argument, or the extension context's cwd when the argument is omitted) is a directory other than the parent process cwd | `headless` |
| normal `agent`/`task` | `inline` |

Supported explicit backend values are `auto`, `inline`, `headless`, and `tmux`. Most users should omit `backend`. Use `visible: true` only when you want a tmux-backed visible worker.

`inline` runs the child session inside the parent Pi process and inherits the parent's ambient extensions. An extension that re-registers a built-in tool (for example a `bash` wrapper) binds that tool to the parent's process cwd, so inline cannot guarantee that tools operate inside a managed worktree or in another `cwd`. Auto-selection therefore uses `headless` for those requests, and an explicit `backend: "inline"` combined with a worktree request is rejected as a validation error instead of silently running against the shared checkout.

Child sessions load Pi's normal ambient extensions and skills by default, so package tools such as web access are available when enabled in Pi settings. Pass `extensions: []` or `skills: []` for a hermetic child. Recursive subagent spawning is blocked by excluding the `subagent` tool from child sessions.

## Agent definitions

When `agent` names a Pi agent markdown file, the engine injects that agent's body as system prompt context and inherits supported frontmatter such as `model`, `thinking`, and `tools`.

`tools` declared in the agent file are that agent's authority ceiling. Call-level `tools` may narrow the set, including `tools: []`, but cannot add tools the agent did not declare. If an agent file omits `tools`, call-level `tools` is rejected for that named agent; omit `tools` to use Pi's default surface.

For agentless model-backed runs, call-level `tools` can set the full tool allowlist. Use `tools: []` to run an agentless task with no tools.

`systemPrompt` is a full override for orchestrators that compile prompts themselves. When provided, it is passed as the final system prompt and no agent prompt is appended. If `agent` is also provided, the agent file is still loaded for approval and frontmatter policy (`tools`, `model`, `thinking`), but its body is not appended to the prompt.

Use `roleContext` for extra worker role instructions without creating a reusable agent file:

```json
{
  "roleContext": "Act as a strict release-readiness reviewer.",
  "task": "Review the current package metadata."
}
```

Agent lookup supports:

```text
~/.pi/agent/agents/*.md   # global agents
.pi/agents/*.md          # project-local agents
```

Use `agentScope` to constrain lookup:

```text
auto | global | project
```

Project-local agents are repository-controlled. The engine uses them without prompting by default; set `confirmProjectAgents:true` in interactive Pi sessions to require confirmation, or use `agentScope:"global"` to avoid project-local agents entirely.

## Model controls

Model-backed runs accept optional model controls:

```json
{
  "agent": "scout",
  "task": "Audit this repo.",
  "model": "kimi-coding/kimi-for-coding",
  "thinking": "xhigh"
}
```

Aliases:

```text
thinking | thinkingLevel | reasoningLevel
```

Supported thinking levels:

```text
off | minimal | low | medium | high | xhigh
```

These options may also be set per task in `tasks[]`.

Timeout notes:

- `timeoutMs` on a run is the worker execution deadline. If omitted, pi-subagent does not impose a run timeout.
- `action:"wait"` uses `timeoutMs` as a polling deadline and defaults to 60 seconds. Its `status:"completed"` means polling reached a terminal run; check `snapshot.status` for run success/failure/cancellation.
- `onComplete:"notify"` uses an internal completion monitor with a long safety window (up to 24h when no `timeoutMs` is set); it does not kill the worker. The monitor polls in the parent process and has no cancellation handle, so long-lived SDK embeddings should prefer `onComplete:"detach"` plus explicit `action:"status"`/`"wait"` polling. Orchestrators that need a 4h or other SLA should pass `timeoutMs` explicitly on the run.

## Artifacts

Runs write durable evidence under:

```text
.pi/agent/runs/
├── .locks/<run-id>.lock      # per-run mutation lock (directory), beside the run
└── <run-id>/
    ├── run.json
    ├── events.jsonl
    └── attempts/
        └── <attempt-id>/
            ├── result.json
            ├── worker.json
            ├── task.md
            ├── system-prompt.md
            ├── stdout.log
            ├── stderr.log
            └── output.log
```

Run locks live in the hidden `.locks/` directory beside the run directories (earlier versions kept `run.lock` inside each run directory), so a lock stays a stable fence while its run directory is renamed or removed by `prune`. Two engine versions mutating the same run concurrently do not exclude each other; in practice a run is only ever mutated by the engine that launched it.

`worker.json` is the launch payload a detached worker reads once at startup. Long prompt strings are not inlined: the task text is stored in `task.md` and the compiled system prompt (when present) in `system-prompt.md`, and `worker.json` references them as `input.taskRef` / `input.systemPromptRef` with `{ path, bytes, sha256 }`. The worker resolves each reference from the payload's own directory and refuses a sidecar whose size or digest does not match, so the payload digest recorded by the durable launch barrier still binds the prompt bytes. Payloads written by earlier versions with inline `input.task` / `input.systemPrompt` remain valid and are accepted unchanged; a payload may not carry both forms of the same field. Callers that already persist the identical prompt bytes elsewhere may hard-link to these sidecars.

`result.json` carries `metadata.provider`, `metadata.model`, `metadata.usage` (token/cost totals summed across the run's assistant messages), and `metadata.stopReason` on every backend; headless and tmux derive them from Pi's JSON event stream, inline from the SDK session's messages.

`run.json` records a `parentSessionId` field: the Pi session id of the session that launched the run, injected from the tool context (not a model-settable argument). Consumers (e.g. status panels) can use it to scope a shared per-`cwd` runs directory to the session that owns each run. The field is omitted when no session id is available, and older records simply lack it.

Recent runs also write a small locator file under Pi's global subagent-run index. Locators older than `PI_SUBAGENT_RUN_LOCATOR_PRUNE_AFTER_MS` (default 30 days; a negative value disables pruning) are swept in the background the first time a process writes a locator, at most 500 per sweep, and again whenever the run panel lists the index. A locator contains the `runId`, absolute `cwd`, optional `runsDir`, optional `parentSessionId`, optional `correlationId`, and `updatedAt`. It is not authoritative evidence and can become stale if the pointed-to run directory is moved or deleted; use `run.json`, `events.jsonl`, and attempt `result.json` as the source of truth.

Older `schemaVersion: 1` artifacts under `<run-id>/<task-id>/` are still readable for compatibility.

Tool responses return compact status and artifact references rather than raw logs.

## TUI monitor

```text
/subagent panel
```

The panel shows run/attempt details, workspace/artifact paths, dependency metadata, event tail, and log tail. It has three scopes:

- `session`: runs whose `run.json.parentSessionId` matches the current Pi session. This is the default when a session id is available.
- `cwd`: runs under the current workspace's `.pi/agent/runs`, including legacy records that lack `parentSessionId`.
- `all`: the global locator index plus current-cwd legacy records.

Status filters are `all`, `running`, `completed`, and `failed`. In the `all` status view, the default list shows all active runs plus recent terminal runs only: 20 for `session`/`cwd`, 50 for `all`. The `completed` and `failed` filters use the same recent terminal cap; `running` is uncapped. The header reports `shown/total`, and when older matching runs are hidden, press `m` in the panel to show more; no separate command is needed. The panel keeps a fixed-height layout, uses an internally scrollable detail pane, and never renders raw `parentSessionId` values.

Stale or malformed locators are counted in the header and skipped. Active runs whose process metadata is dead and whose heartbeat/update timestamp is stale are rendered read-only as `failed` with failure `stale`; the panel does not mutate run records. It may prune old stale locator pointers only; use `action:"reconcile"` to repair local registry state from durable artifacts when possible.

The panel is for human inspection; existing-run tool actions remain the programmatic interface.

## Environment variables

Operator-facing:

| Variable | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `PI_SUBAGENT_RUN_INDEX_DIR` | `~/.pi/agent/subagent-runs` | Directory for the global run-locator index used to resolve a `runId` without `cwd`. |
| `PI_SUBAGENT_RUN_LOCATOR_PRUNE_AFTER_MS` | 30 days | Age after which locators are swept (background sweep on locator writes and when the panel lists runs). Negative disables pruning. |
| `PI_SUBAGENT_HEARTBEAT_MS` | `5000` | Durable-worker heartbeat interval written to the attempt record; reconciliation treats missing heartbeats as liveness evidence. |
| `PI_SUBAGENT_EVENT_READ_CACHE_MAX` | `64` | Maximum `events.jsonl` files kept in the in-process read cache used by status/wait/panel. `0` disables the cache. |
| `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` | `~/.pi/agent` | Pi's agent directory; the sandbox grants write access to exactly its `settings.json.lock`, `auth.json.lock`, and `trust.json.lock`. |

Internal (set by the engine for its own child processes; do not set by hand):

| Variable | Set by | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `PI_SUBAGENT_DURABLE_WORKER_BINDING_JSON` | async launcher | Binds a durable worker to its run/attempt; stripped from tmux child environments. |
| `PI_SUBAGENT_TMUX_OWNERSHIP_TOKEN` | tmux runner | Ownership token verified before a tmux session is signalled. |
| `PI_SUBAGENT_TOOL_RESULT_BUDGET_MAX_CHARS`, `…_STATE_PATH`, `…_FORCE_EVICT_FRACTION` | headless runner | Carries the `toolResultBudget` option and context-recovery state into the headless child. |

Test-only seams (used by `npm run validate`; no effect in normal operation unless set):

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `PI_SUBAGENT_DURABLE_WORKER_START_DELAY_MS` | Delays worker execution start so interrupt checks can race it. |
| `PI_SUBAGENT_DURABLE_WORKER_TERMINAL_WRITE_DELAY_MS` | Delays the worker's terminal write to exercise late-commit paths. |
| `PI_SUBAGENT_PANEL_NOW_MS` | Fixes the panel's notion of "now" for deterministic rendering. |
| `PI_SUBAGENT_CHECK_MODEL`, `PI_SUBAGENT_CHECK_THINKING` | Pins model-backed check scenarios to a provider/model and thinking level; without credentials those scenarios report `skipped`. |

## Development validation

In this source checkout:

```bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps   # peer deps (pi-coding-agent) are required for typecheck
npm run check                    # typecheck + static checks
npm run check:all                # plus model-backed integration checks (needs model auth)
npm run validate
npm pack --dry-run --json
```
