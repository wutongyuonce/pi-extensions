# Configuration

Configuration controls browser access, strict accessibility execution, and the macOS agent cursor.

## Files

Global config:

```text
~/.pi/agent/extensions/pi-computer-use.json
```

Project config:

```text
.pi/computer-use.json
```

Project config overrides global config. Environment variables override both.

Example:

```json
{
  "browser_use": true,
  "managed_browser": "chrome",
  "headless": false,
  "cursor_overlay": true
}
```

Run `/computer-use` in Pi to show the active config and its source.

## Options

### `browser_use`

Default: `true`

When `false`, the extension refuses known browser windows. This is useful for projects that should not control browsers.

Known browser families include Safari, Chrome and Chromium-family browsers, Firefox, Arc, Brave, Edge, Vivaldi, and Helium.

### `managed_browser`

Default: `"chrome"`

Selects `"helium"` or `"chrome"` for `launch_browser`. The debugging port is always allocated internally and isn't part of the model-facing contract.

### `headless`

Default: `false`

When `true`, actions must remain in the background. Raw pointer events, raw keyboard events, foreground focus fallback, cursor takeover, and the agent cursor overlay are blocked. When `false` (the default), Pi prefers verified semantic activation when it is credible, preserves the focus established by editable clicks for dependent keyboard input, and may retry keyboard input in the foreground when a background attempt conclusively produced no value change. Ambiguous pointer actions are never replayed blindly.

### `cursor_overlay`

Default: `true`

When `true`, macOS pointer actions enqueue a click-through agent cursor animation to the native grounded point during non-headless background delivery. Foreground actions that control the physical cursor don't display the overlay. The overlay doesn't move the system pointer, accept input, or delay the action. Set it to `false` for invisible automation. `headless: true` always suppresses it regardless of this setting.

## Environment variables

```bash
PI_COMPUTER_USE_BROWSER_USE=0
PI_COMPUTER_USE_BROWSER_USE=1
PI_COMPUTER_USE_MANAGED_BROWSER=helium
PI_COMPUTER_USE_MANAGED_BROWSER=chrome
PI_COMPUTER_USE_HEADLESS=0
PI_COMPUTER_USE_HEADLESS=1
PI_COMPUTER_USE_CURSOR_OVERLAY=0
PI_COMPUTER_USE_CURSOR_OVERLAY=1
PI_COMPUTER_USE_DELIVERY_POLICY=default
PI_COMPUTER_USE_DELIVERY_POLICY=foreground
PI_COMPUTER_USE_CDP_PORT=9222
```

`PI_COMPUTER_USE_HEADLESS=1` prohibits foreground fallback. `PI_COMPUTER_USE_DELIVERY_POLICY` is a debugging input; normal policy belongs in configuration rather than individual model calls.

## CDP browser support

`PI_COMPUTER_USE_CDP_PORT` enables Chrome DevTools Protocol support for Chromium-family browsers. Launch the browser with `--remote-debugging-port=<port>` and set this variable to the same port.

When CDP is active, discovered pages participate in the same root and state system as desktop UI. `launch_browser` configures CDP automatically and returns an observed page state. `navigate_browser` and `evaluate_browser` accept only CDP browser-page states; native browser windows continue to use the normal desktop observe/act tools.

With the variable unset, CDP is inactive.
