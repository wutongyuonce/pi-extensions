# pi-tidy

Focused, independently installable packages that make [Pi](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-mono) easier to follow.

Long agent turns are hard to read in Pi's native transcript: every tool call renders as a boxed card, the model's goal behind each call is invisible, and delegated work has no compact live view. pi-tidy replaces that with dense, reason-first output while preserving native execution behavior.

Each package solves one transcript or workflow problem. Install only the ones you want — there is no umbrella runtime package.

**Stable (npm):**

```bash
pi install npm:@mobrienv/pi-tidy-tools      # compact, reason-first tool cards
pi install npm:@mobrienv/pi-tidy-subagents  # foreground and background subagent fan-out
pi install npm:@mobrienv/pi-tidy-memory     # durable, backend-neutral memory
```

**Experimental (source only for now):** `@mobrienv/pi-tidy-footer` ships on `main` but is not published to npm yet. Its API, config, and layout may still change before a first release. It lives as a monorepo package directory, so install the repo from git and then install that package path:

```bash
# clone via Pi's git installer (also registers the monorepo root)
pi install git:github.com/mikeyobrien/pi-tidy-tools@main

# the experimental package is a workspace directory under that clone
pi install ~/.pi/agent/git/github.com/mikeyobrien/pi-tidy-tools/packages/pi-tidy-footer
```

Equivalent sources: `https://github.com/mikeyobrien/pi-tidy-tools@main` or `git:git@github.com:mikeyobrien/pi-tidy-tools@main`. Pin a commit with `@<sha>` if you want a frozen experimental build. Project-local installs use the same sources with `-l`.

## Packages

### [`@mobrienv/pi-tidy-tools`](packages/pi-tidy-tools)

[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/%40mobrienv%2Fpi-tidy-tools)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mobrienv/pi-tidy-tools)

**See what your Pi agent is doing at a glance.** Replaces Pi's built-in tool cards with compact, reason-first output while preserving native execution behavior.

[![Native Pi tool cards compared with compact pi-tidy-tools output](packages/pi-tidy-tools/docs/comparison.png)](packages/pi-tidy-tools)

- Restyles `read`, `write`, `edit`, `bash`, `grep`, `find`, and `ls`
- Shows the goal, concrete target, and useful result in one or two lines
- Keeps live status, errors, expansion, terminal-width truncation, and native tool behavior
- Adds configurable layouts and a `/diff` recap of the previous turn's changes

```bash
pi install npm:@mobrienv/pi-tidy-tools
```

### [`@mobrienv/pi-tidy-subagents`](packages/pi-tidy-subagents)

[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/%40mobrienv%2Fpi-tidy-subagents)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mobrienv/pi-tidy-subagents)

**Fan work out to child Pi agents without losing the thread.** Adds resource-aware subagent delegation — foreground or background — with compact live state and ordered results.

  <img src="packages/pi-tidy-subagents/docs/visual.png" width="720" alt="Mixed foreground and background pi-tidy-subagents cards, active widget, durable stamps, management overlay, expanded detail, and narrow viewport">
</a>

- Runs independent child prompts concurrently through a session-wide queue
- Shows one scan-friendly activity per child, with full recent detail on expansion
- Backgrounds long-running children and delivers their results when the parent is idle
- Preserves healthy sibling results when an individual child fails
- Records complete responses, usage, and normalized events in versioned run artifacts

```bash
pi install npm:@mobrienv/pi-tidy-subagents
```

### [`@mobrienv/pi-tidy-memory`](packages/pi-tidy-memory)

[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/%40mobrienv%2Fpi-tidy-memory)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mobrienv/pi-tidy-memory)

**Give Pi durable memory without tying the agent to one storage engine.** The package exposes compact recall, retain, and reflect tools through a backend-neutral contract. Hindsight is the first adapter.

- Connects to authenticated self-hosted Hindsight servers with native `fetch`
- Keeps credentials in environment variables or a protected env file
- Marks recalled content as untrusted historical data
- Offers optional automatic recall and retain hooks, both disabled by default
- Uses left-edge, two-line why/result cards with a live-only state mark and native settled backgrounds
- Leaves room for additional backends without changing the Pi-facing tools

```bash
pi install npm:@mobrienv/pi-tidy-memory
```

### [`@mobrienv/pi-tidy-footer`](packages/pi-tidy-footer) · experimental

**Keep the important state visible on a phone-sized terminal.** The footer anchors model and context to the right while fitting branch, Codex quotas, and active extension statuses into the flexible left side.

> Experimental: on `main`, not on npm yet. Install from a local checkout. Layout tiers and CodexBar integration may still change before `0.1.0` is published.

- Designed around 52–56-column Termux sessions
- Uses two justified, ANSI- and Unicode-safe lines
- Reads five-hour and seven-day quota usage from the `codexbar` CLI
- Polls outside rendering and keeps the last good quota snapshot

```bash
pi install git:github.com/mikeyobrien/pi-tidy-tools@main
pi install ~/.pi/agent/git/github.com/mikeyobrien/pi-tidy-tools/packages/pi-tidy-footer
```

## About the collection

Packages follow the `@mobrienv/pi-tidy-*` naming convention. Each package owns its runtime, documentation, tests, version, changelog, and npm release when published.

`@mobrienv/pi-tidy-tools`, `@mobrienv/pi-tidy-subagents`, and `@mobrienv/pi-tidy-memory` are published independently on npm. `@mobrienv/pi-tidy-footer` remains experimental and is available from this repository until its first release.

The private root manifest exists for workspace development and keeps existing local-checkout installs pointed at `pi-tidy-tools`; published packages remain independent.

## Develop

Install once at the repository root and validate every workspace:

```bash
npm install
npm test
npm run check
```

Coverage bars (c8) and mutation testing (Stryker) are available monorepo-wide or per package:

```bash
npm run test:coverage
npm run test:mutation
```

HTML reports land under each package's `coverage/` and `reports/mutation/` directories. The canonical [quality-gate policy](docs/quality-gates.md) sets per-file coverage floors of 90% statements/lines/functions and 80% branches, plus an 80% package mutation break score. Package `.c8rc.json` and `stryker.config.mjs` files enforce those values.

Target one package during development:

```bash
npm test --workspace @mobrienv/pi-tidy-tools
npm run check --workspace @mobrienv/pi-tidy-tools
npm run test:coverage --workspace @mobrienv/pi-tidy-tools
npm pack --workspace @mobrienv/pi-tidy-tools --dry-run

npm test --workspace @mobrienv/pi-tidy-subagents
npm run check --workspace @mobrienv/pi-tidy-subagents
npm run test:coverage --workspace @mobrienv/pi-tidy-subagents
npm pack --workspace @mobrienv/pi-tidy-subagents --dry-run

npm test --workspace @mobrienv/pi-tidy-memory
npm run check --workspace @mobrienv/pi-tidy-memory
npm run test:coverage --workspace @mobrienv/pi-tidy-memory
npm pack --workspace @mobrienv/pi-tidy-memory --dry-run

npm test --workspace @mobrienv/pi-tidy-footer
npm run check --workspace @mobrienv/pi-tidy-footer
npm run test:coverage --workspace @mobrienv/pi-tidy-footer
npm pack --workspace @mobrienv/pi-tidy-footer --dry-run
```

Publishable packages live at `packages/pi-tidy-<name>` and use the npm name `@mobrienv/pi-tidy-<name>`. Releases use package-qualified tags such as `pi-tidy-tools-v0.2.0` so every package can version and publish independently.
