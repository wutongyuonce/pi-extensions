# 💬 pi-btw — Ask Side Questions Without Derailing the Main Task

[![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@narumitw/pi-btw)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@narumitw/pi-btw) [![Pi extension](https://img.shields.io/badge/Pi-extension-blue)](https://pi.dev) [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green.svg)](./LICENSE)

Ask questions in a temporary side thread without adding them to the main Pi conversation.
Only context you explicitly bring back is loaded into the main editor.

## ✨ Features

- Starts a side thread immediately with `/btw <question>` or opens the manager with `/btw`.
- Uses any persisted main-session branch as context without switching branches.
- Supports scrollable answers, transcript search, a clickable jump-to-latest control, follow-up questions, queued steering, and in-memory resume.
- Offers fullscreen, side-thread-left, and side-thread-right workspaces with Pi's live main-thread view, click-to-focus input, and a draggable remembered divider.
- Renders supported Mermaid fences as width-safe, themed Unicode diagrams without a browser or network request.
- Keeps side questions and answers out of the main conversation by default.
- Brings back the latest answer, a question suffix, an exact range, or the complete thread only when requested.
- Uses Pi's current model and thinking level or saved pi-btw choices.
- Offers BTW-only exit, thinking-cycle, and bring-to-main keybindings.

## 📦 Install

```bash
pi install npm:@narumitw/pi-btw
```

Try without installing permanently:

```bash
pi -e npm:@narumitw/pi-btw
```

Build and try this package locally from the repository root:

```bash
npm --workspace @narumitw/pi-btw run build
pi -e ./packages/pi-btw
```

The package declares `dist/index.ts`, so an unbuilt local checkout must run the build before Pi loads the package directory.
Pi extensions run with the Pi process's user permissions, so install only trusted packages.

## 🚀 Quick start

In TUI mode, run `/btw <question>` to start immediately or `/btw` to choose context and settings first.
The side thread stays separate until you explicitly bring context to the main editor.

## 💬 Commands

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `/btw` | Choose context, start or resume a side thread, or change settings. |
| `/btw <question>` | Start a new side thread immediately with the supplied question. |

Both routes require TUI mode and a model with usable credentials; see [Settings](#-settings).
Side questions and selected conversation context are sent to that model's provider.
Bringing context back fills the main editor without submitting; replacing an existing draft requires confirmation.
Ctrl+C cancels the response and discards the current draft and queued questions, but completed exchanges remain resumable in memory.
Read the [workflow guide](./docs/workflows.md) for context selection, copying, search, steering, and draft recovery; `/new`, `/resume`, `/reload`, and restart discard retained threads.

## ⚙️ Settings

By default, `/btw` uses the current session model.
Open `/btw` → **Settings** → **Model** to choose an available model or **Same as main thread** to remove the override.
The searchable picker follows the current Pi model scope and saves immediately without changing the main session model.
A manually configured available model outside that scope remains active and visible until you explicitly choose another option.

You can also edit the user settings file directly:

```text
$PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR/pi-btw.json
```

The normal location is `~/.pi/agent/pi-btw.json`.
`PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` is an existing Pi setting; pi-btw does not add any environment variables.

```json
{
  "model": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5",
  "thinkingLevel": "low",
  "rememberThinkingLevelChanges": true,
  "fullscreenCopyOnSelect": true,
  "layout": "left-pane",
  "sidePaneRatio": 0.5
}
```

The `model` value uses `provider/model-id` format.
Only the first `/` is the separator, so model IDs may contain additional slashes, such as `openrouter/anthropic/claude-sonnet`.
The configured model must exist in Pi's model registry and have usable credentials.
If it is missing or unauthenticated, pi-btw warns and falls back to the current session model.
If neither model is available, `/btw` reports an error and stops.
This selection affects only `/btw`; it does not change the main session model.
Model changes apply when the next new or resumed side thread starts.

Pi calls its reasoning setting the **thinking level**.
In Settings, choose **Same as main thread** to start each new side thread from the main thread's current thinking level.
This is stored by omitting `thinkingLevel` from `pi-btw.json`.

Set `thinkingLevel` only when you want a fixed pi-btw starting level.
Accepted fixed values are `off`, `minimal`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, and `max`.
The initial value and shortcut cycle are clamped to the selected side model's capabilities using Pi's model rules.
Resumed side threads keep their own local thinking level instead of re-syncing with the main thread.
Pi-btw does not read, write, or change the main session's `defaultThinkingLevel`.

`rememberThinkingLevelChanges` controls only persistence for fixed thinking levels and defaults to `true` when omitted.
A side-thread shortcut always changes that side thread immediately.
When a fixed thinking level is selected and remembering is on, the concrete level is written for the next invocation; when off, `pi-btw.json` stays unchanged.
When **Same as main thread** is selected, shortcut changes stay local even when remembering is on.
If a shortcut write fails, the local change remains active and pi-btw warns that it was not remembered.
A failed Settings-screen save instead restores the previous displayed value.

`fullscreenCopyOnSelect` controls only pi-btw's dedicated workspace and defaults to `true` when omitted.
Turn **Copy selection automatically** off to retain highlighted selections and copy them with Pi's effective `app.message.copy` binding.
Pi-btw does not inherit Pi core's setting of the same name because Pi's public extension API does not expose its effective value.

`layout` controls the dedicated workspace and defaults to `fullscreen` when omitted.
Accepted values are `fullscreen`, `left-pane`, and `right-pane`.
The pane names identify the side thread's position; the other pane reuses Pi's native main-thread rendering at pane width and stays current while BTW is open.
A single muted divider separates the panes; click either pane to move keyboard focus to it.
Drag the divider with the primary mouse button to resize both panes.
The side-thread share is limited to 20–80% and saved as `sidePaneRatio` when the button is released, independent of whether the side thread is on the left or right.
If the save fails, the workspace restores the last saved ratio and reports the error.
Pi's search and keyboard viewport controls apply to the active pane.
The mouse wheel scrolls the pane under the pointer without moving keyboard focus, and both panes continue redrawing while either pane is active.
If you selected context from the main-thread tree, the main pane still shows the active main thread while the side model receives the selected branch.
Pane layouts collapse to the side thread alone below 80 terminal columns and return keyboard focus to it.
Choose **Side-thread layout** in Settings; changes apply the next time a new or resumed BTW workspace opens.

### Keybindings

Open `/btw` → **Settings**, select a shortcut row, then choose **Edit key combination…** or **Restore default**.
Type a key name such as `ctrl+q` or `f6`; this is not a key-recording prompt.
Changes save immediately and apply when opening or resuming BTW, without `/reload`. Escape cancels an unfinished edit, not earlier saves.
The literal `/btw settings` remains a side question, not a settings subcommand.

| JSON field under `keybindings` | Default | Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `exit` | `ctrl+c` | Cancel and leave the dedicated side-thread workspace, including its nested dialogs. |
| `cycleThinkingLevel` | Inherit Pi's `app.thinking.cycle` | Cycle supported levels while composing or generating. |
| `bringToMain` | `ctrl+r` | Open the bring-to-main chooser after a completed answer. |

For example, merge these overrides into `pi-btw.json`:

```json
{
  "keybindings": {
    "exit": "ctrl+q",
    "cycleThinkingLevel": "f6",
    "bringToMain": "f7"
  }
}
```

Each override accepts one Pi key name with optional `ctrl`, `shift`, `alt`, and `super` modifiers; modifier order and letter case do not matter.
Letters, digits, Pi special keys and symbols are recognized, except the literal `+`, which Pi's matcher cannot parse as a base key.
Function keys `f1`–`f12` and Escape accept no modifiers; Clear accepts only no modifier, Shift, or Ctrl.
Actual availability depends on the terminal; `super` and some modified combinations require extended keyboard reporting.

New overrides cannot take ordinary typing keys or conflict with BTW actions, Pi editing, selection, search, scrolling, or enabled manual-copy bindings.
Pi's explicitly configured printable thinking shortcuts remain inherited for compatibility.
If a saved override becomes conflicting, BTW warns and uses an available default; if none is usable, that shortcut is unavailable and its activation hint is omitted.
An explicitly unbound Pi thinking action stays unbound. Remove an override field to restore its default; neither saving nor resetting modifies Pi's global keybindings.
**Ctrl+C always remains available as hard cancel**, even after configuring another exit key. Shortcut handling does not interpret bracketed-paste payloads as commands.

### Persistence

Reading a missing settings file has no side effects.
Pi-btw creates it only after a Settings change, a remembered shortcut change, or a divider drag.
Within one Pi process, saves run in order and publish atomically through a same-directory temporary file and rename.
Saves preserve other recognized settings and unknown fields.
Malformed or invalid files block saves and remain unchanged.
Files must be valid UTF-8 and no larger than 64 KiB.
Separate Pi processes and external editors are outside the in-process ordering boundary.
The file is read for every `/btw` invocation, so edits apply without `/reload`.

## 🚧 Limitations

- `/btw` supports TUI mode only.
- Only the clicked pane receives keyboard input; hovering or scrolling over the other pane does not move focus.
- Resume state is memory-only and lasts only for the current extension instance.
- A side thread retains the latest 40,000 characters of main-conversation context and adds a truncation notice when earlier content is omitted.
- Clipboard access depends on Pi's host helper, the operating system, and the terminal.
- Malformed, unsupported, or oversized Mermaid diagrams remain readable as fenced source; partial parses also show a warning.
- Pi versions before 0.85 omit the clickable jump-to-latest control.
