The policy that landed the 2026-08-17 arc (11 PRs, every one adversarially
reviewed, zero unreviewed merges). Apply it to each PR in the queue.

A fix to a CI lane or workflow is accepted only when that lane's own run on
the PR's exact head completes inside its `timeout-minutes`, with the
acceptance surface quoted from that run's log. Any self-bound inside the lane
must sit below the job cap by a stated margin so the loud-failure path is
reachable.

Every PR body starts with `## Why`, `## Notes for the reviewer`, and
`## Change outline`, followed by the existing `## Summary`, `## Tests`,
`## Blast radius`, `## Class sweep`, and `## Observability` sections. The
change outline is the changed symbol's caller/callee tree with `+`/`-` on
moved lines; include only structural views that changed.

## The loop, per PR

1. **Review.** Spawn `pi-lens-reviewer` (worktree isolation) with the PR
   number, a one-paragraph summary of the claim, and any PR-specific attack
   angles. Self-authored and small PRs get reviewed too — the depth follows
   the review tier below, never the priority label.
2. **Fix rounds.** Send findings back to the PR's original author agent when
   its worktree survives (SendMessage — cheapest context); otherwise spawn
   `pi-lens-fixer` on the branch with the findings inlined.
   **Since #2486, `SubagentStop` REAPS the stopped agent's own worktree**
   (maintainer decision, 2026-09-02, reversing the earlier "never removes
   here" rule, which left ten stale trees in one afternoon). So by default an
   agent's tree is gone the moment it finishes, and SendMessage to it lands on
   a branch with no checkout. Its branch survives — a tree is never removed
   unless its HEAD is already in an `origin/*` ref — so nothing committed is
   lost and a fresh `pi-lens-fixer` on the branch always works. If this
   session intends to resume fixers by SendMessage, export
   `PILENS_HYGIENE_KEEP_AGENT_TREES=1` for the session (or add
   `--keep-agent-tree` to the registered hook) and the reap is off.
   Kept trees are then reaped by the `SessionStart` sweep —
   which runs on `startup` and `resume` only, not on `/clear`, compaction or a
   fork — once they have been idle ≥30m and are clean and pushed. Idle is
   measured from the checkout directory and the worktree's HEAD (and its
   reflog), never from the git index, so the sweep's own dirty check cannot
   make a finished tree look busy.
   A tree with uncommitted work, or with work not yet on an `origin/*` ref, is
   never removed at any age, by any sweep — so a fix round in flight is safe by
   its own state, not by the clock.
3. **Verify.** The SAME reviewer verifies each fix round with its own probes.
   Do not take the fixer's word; do not swap reviewers mid-PR. A reviewer's
   worktree is an `agent-*` tree too, so once its report lands the tree is
   clean+pushed and `SubagentStop` reaps it exactly like a fixer's — a
   SendMessage resume finds no checkout, same as above. Recreate it: the
   merge-train practice is a FRESH reviewer worktree per VERIFY round, not a
   kept one. Continuity is the reviewer AGENT (SendMessage still reaches the
   same identity, so the same judgment and probes carry over); the checkout
   under it is expected to be rebuilt each round, not preserved. Do not set
   `--keep-agent-tree` / `PILENS_HYGIENE_KEEP_AGENT_TREES=1` merely to dodge
   this — that decision stays off by default (see step 2).
4. **Merge gate.** Merge only when: verdict is merge-ready; every gating check
   genuinely EXECUTED and passed on the exact head SHA
   (`node scripts/ci-verdict.mjs <pr-number|sha>` — a DIRTY PR silently skips
   them, absent is not green); every failing check
   was read and judged (infra failures — codeload 429/503, SARIF-upload
   errors, Initialize-CodeQL outages — may be waved through only with the
   log read and the judgment recorded). A PR that is green on its head but
   whose merge with `origin/master` was not tested against the exact-pin
   sweeps is not green — run the sweep on the merge before merging.
5. **Merge.** `gh pr merge <N> --merge` (merge commit, repo convention).
   If "not up to date", `gh api -X PUT .../pulls/<N>/update-branch`, wait for
   CI, re-gate, merge. On GitHub 503s: retry with backoff, never switch to
   raw-API merge endpoints.
   Alternative, once the verdict is in: apply the `train:approved` label (add
   `train:squash` for a squash merge) and let the merge-train lane workflow
   land it (#2185). The lane merges only when both required checks have
   CONCLUDED success on the exact current head, so a fix round pushed after
   labeling re-gates itself. Removing the label aborts. Steps 1 through 4 are
   unchanged: only the maintainer applies the label, and only after the
   review verdict.
6. **After each merge.** Master moved: check other open PRs for BEHIND/DIRTY,
   check in-flight agents for file overlap with the merged diff and nudge
   affected ones to merge origin/master before their next push.
   Then prune the lane — and ONLY the lane: the merged-ness test is "this
   tree's branch is the head of the PR just merged" (`gh pr view <n> --json
   headRefName`), never `merge-base --is-ancestor`: a live fixer's branch
   with no commits yet passes the ancestor test, and on 2026-09-06 that
   removed #2358's tree with its uncommitted work. `git worktree remove` every tree on the merged
   branch (fixer AND reviewer trees, wherever they were created) and delete
   the merged local branch. A lane's tree lives until its PR merges, not
   after — the orchestrator owns this step; the reaper only sees
   `.claude/worktrees/agent-*`, and on 2026-09-06 twenty-one merged trees
   were still standing at the regroup.

## Queue ordering

Order by dependency, not age: a PR whose schema/API another PR must consume
merges first (the consumer then rebases and wires the new surface). Two PRs
editing the same file get an explicit order decided up front. Log-schema
changes must extend exact-key pins (`BASELINE_KEYS`-style), never loosen them.

## Quota gate (orchestrator)

Before ANY new dispatch (not a fix round on an open PR): know the account's
5h and weekly usage. Above 75% of the 5h window or 85% of the weekly window,
no new work — finish in-flight lanes and merge on green. The numbers are
readable live: `GET https://api.anthropic.com/api/oauth/usage` with the OAuth
token from `~/.claude/.credentials.json` (`anthropic-beta: oauth-2025-04-20`)
returns `five_hour.utilization` / `seven_day.utilization` and reset times; the
`~/.claude/hooks/quota-gate.mjs` PreToolUse hook on `Agent` reads them and
blocks dispatch above the thresholds (no hand-written fallback;
`QUOTA_GATE_OVERRIDE=1` lifts it when the maintainer says so). Read the meters at session start and before
every refill; state them in the lane ledger. Standing rule from
2026-09-03, lifted only when the maintainer says so.

## Brief contract (orchestrator)

Before dispatching any issue that adds a shared helper or seam: grep for
same-shape siblings yourself and write the fold into the SAME slice, or write
the sibling list, the reason folding is unsafe in one PR, and the follow-up
issue into the brief. AGENTS.md's net-count rule binds the brief author; the
fixer and reviewer only enforce what the brief scoped. #2530 shipped a fifth
bound helper because the brief deferred the fold without a reason.

## External reports (orchestrator)

The contract lives in AGENTS.md, "Issue triage (standing rule)" — assess the
report against the code before accepting or dispatching, ask the one or two
facts that would change the design, **do not dispatch work that depends on an
unanswered load-bearing question**, mirror the answer on the issue and point
the worker there rather than at a paraphrase, and cite the reporter's reasoning
as authority. Read it there; this section only points at it.

The train-specific consequence: an external lane's first dispatch is often
worth delaying by one exchange. On 2026-09-12 a fixer was dispatched on #3000
between asking the question and receiving the answer, and the answer invalidated
the brief's central premise — the correction cost a mid-flight `plegma_send` and
rework that waiting ten minutes would have avoided entirely.

## Filing issues (orchestrator)

Every `gh issue create` carries one TYPE label, at least one `area:*`, and
exactly one `priority:p1|p2|p3` (AGENTS.md #1676 rubric). The priority labels
were found deleted from the repo on 2026-09-03 and recreated (#2553); an
issue filed without one is a triage defect, not a shortcut.

## Round-count rail (orchestrator)

When a verify round reports that a fix round introduced a NEW defect on the
same record or seam (not merely left one), the next fix brief opens with
AGENTS.md's state-space step — invariants, writers × axes, the cell list —
written into the PR body BEFORE any edit, and the fixer is Opus. Never send a
third patch-only round: #2528 went r2 → r3 → r4 on one cache record, each
round fixing three findings and adding two, until the model was demanded.

## Orchestrator invariants (any orchestrator, not only Claude)

These are the habits the train depends on. They live here, not in any one
operator's private notes, so a different orchestrator can run the same train.

- **Contracts move in the same session.** When a review or a dogfood finding
  reveals a defect CLASS (not an instance), add a numbered shape to AGENTS.md's
  catalog with the issue ref and a one-line screen, extend the fixer's screen
  list, and cite the number in the next brief — before the next dispatch. "To
  err twice is not the mark of a wise man." (2026-09-03: shapes 28–36 came out
  of one day's reviews this way.)
- **Second instance of a catalogued shape opens the consolidation lane, not a
  third instance fix (2026-09-09).** The trigger is the shape recurring at all,
  not only twice in one session: when a review, an issue or a dogfood finding
  is the second member of a shape already in AGENTS.md's catalog, the
  orchestrator files the consolidation lane BEFORE the second instance merges,
  with three fixed deliverables: one seam every consumer calls, one log line
  per resolution (which value was chosen and why, throttled once per key per
  session), and one bounded degradation record for the fallback path. The
  record: #2691 (yamllint cwd) and #2756 (Prettier ignore cwd) were shape 40
  twice in one week; each was fixed at its own seam with no log line, and the
  maintainer had to ask for the seam (#2777). "Contracts move in the same
  session" covers the catalog row; this rule covers the code.
- **An external bug's first round is the probe, not the fix (2026-09-09).**
  For any bug reported from outside (or any bug whose symptom is a tool
  verdict), the first delegation is an investigator or a fixer whose FIRST
  deliverable is the reporter's symptom reproduced through the production
  entry point (the tool handler / MCP tool, not a seam beneath it), red on
  master, before any state-space table or edit. A fix brief that names a
  suspected seam is a hypothesis and says so. The record: #2776 spent seven
  fixer rounds on `clients/lsp/client.ts` (pull-vs-push classification) —
  each internally consistent, each verified — before a premise probe through
  `LSPService.touchFile` showed master already returned the pushed
  diagnostic; one investigator round through `createLspDiagnosticsTool`
  then found the real cause in `tools/lsp-diagnostics.ts` (primary/auxiliary
  partition by `diagnostic.source`). AGENTS.md "premise first" already said
  this; the train had been dispatching fixers on the orchestrator's guess.
- **Every "should have been caught by" names a nightly or smoke row, and
  the row is filed the same day.** A detection retrospective that ends in
  prose is not a retrospective. #2776 (emmylua_ls declares pull diagnostics
  but only pushes → false "confirmed clean") was reachable by a
  declared-vs-observed channel probe the capability matrix never ran, and by
  the custom-`lsp.servers` population the matrix never covers.
- **Brief pre-flight by touched surface (2026-09-09).** Before dispatching a
  fixer, read what the fix WILL touch and put the matching dependents into the
  brief's required test set. Every row below cost at least one extra round
  today because the fixer ran only "targeted files":

  | Fix touches | Brief must name |
  |---|---|
  | a new export on a module that has `vi.mock` doubles | every test file that mocks that module (`grep -rl 'vi.mock(".*<module>' tests`), run them all — #2782 r1: 30 reds in 6 files |
  | a field on a durable or shared record (cache entry, diagnostic, ledger row) | old-record parse proof, cache schema version, and every test that deep-equals or snapshots the record — #2783 r1/r3 |
  | a test that spawns a real child (LSP fake server, tool smoke, installer) | the lane admission (header + `vitest.config.ts` project + coverage baseline) and `tests/config/` — #2783 r5 |
  | a new fixture under `tests/fixtures/` | the fixture-contract sweeps for that directory (style-preserving, population guards) — #2782 r2 |
  | a change that touches identifier uses of a glossary-retired synonym | run `tests/config/glossary-synonym-sweep.test.ts` on the head AND on the merge with `origin/master`, then re-pin in the PR from the sweep's own `UNPINNED`/`STALE` output — #3279, #3283, #3284, #3288 |
  | a new `vi.mock` in a test file | run `tests/config/vi-mock-export-sweep.test.ts`; whole-module mocks of a production module must spread `importOriginal` — PR #3268's CI red, fixed by trailing commit `621d61c5c` |
  | a changelog fragment | front matter `section: <Section>` and exactly one top-level `- **Title (refs #N)** —` entry, never `CHANGELOG.md`, validated by `node scripts/check-changelog-fragments.mjs` — PR #3268 r1 shipped `category:` and a paragraph |
  | a PR body | the header gate: exactly one-sentence `## Why`, `## Notes for the reviewer`, `## Change outline`, plus Summary / Tests with `### Test assessment` / Blast radius / Class sweep / Observability; run `node scripts/check-pr-body.mjs --lint-local` before pushing — three PRs this week needed orchestrator body edits |
  | a whole-tree docs restructure of `AGENTS.md` | every governance test that reads `AGENTS.md`, with markers on their own lines — PR #3265 r1 |
  | a raw poll in a test | the flake-shape ratchet; the fix is the governed wait, never a header admission — #2781 r1 |
  | a new, renamed or deleted rule file under `rules/` | `npm run docs:rule-catalogs` and commit the generated catalog; `tests/scripts/rule-catalogs.test.ts` is a strict consumer of every rule file, not of rule ids — #3214 r1 |

- **Sandbox by test shape (2026-09-09).** A lane whose tests spawn children
  (LSP fake server, tool smoke, installer, formatter wire) is dispatched with
  the runner's full-access mode from round 1. #2781 spent four rounds with a
  fixer that could not run its own wire tests and reasoned about ordering
  instead of observing it; the first full-access round found the cause in
  one pass.
- **A CI-only red is reproduced in the job's shape before any fix.** Replicate
  the job env (the `npm test` PATH prefix with `node_modules/.bin`, a pinned
  `HOME`, no `PI_LENS_HOME`) and trace the leg that differs; a fix that only
  passes under `node_modules/.bin/vitest run` is a guess. #2775 carried one
  CI-only red through three rounds until round 5 traced it to the npm PATH
  prefix resolving the dev-dependency `oxfmt` past the mocked `which`.
- **Follow-up rounds go to the same worker by send, not a fresh delegation,**
  while its handle is alive: it keeps the diff and the reasoning, and the
  brief shrinks to the findings. Release only when the lane moves to review.
  A fresh worker on a resume loses uncommitted work.
- **Release a reviewer handle only after reading a merge-ready verdict.** A fix
  round resumes the SAME reviewer via `resumeFrom` with the model pinned. Twice
  this week (PRs #3263 r2 and #3261 r2), release ran in the same batch as the
  read and continuity was lost.
- **Fleet inventory at every settlement.** A one-shot watch misses anything
  that settles while it is disarmed: after each settlement,
  list live workers and read every `done` handle not yet consumed. Two lanes
  sat finished for 90 minutes today.
- **Keep a lane ledger.** One file, one row per lane: issue/PR, worker id,
  round, state, head SHA, merge-order note, and for bug lanes
  `caught by / should have been caught by`; a header line with the quota
  reading and the merged list. Update it on every dispatch, report and merge.
  It is what survives a context reset. `state` is one of exactly:
  `not started`, `fixing rN`, `waiting on CI`, `waiting on review`,
  `waiting on verify`, `blocked`, `ready to merge`, `merged`,
  `needs user decision`, `held` — a fixed vocabulary so a resumed session
  (or a different orchestrator) can build the status table without reading
  the transcripts, and so "needs user decision" and "held" are visible as
  rows rather than buried in prose. (Borrowed 2026-09-07 from the heartbeat
  classification in aromanarguello/roman-skills `orchestrate-lane`.)
- **A lane's worktree lives until its PR merges.** Pruning it after a report
  makes the owning worker un-resumable, so every fix round then costs a fresh
  worker. Prune on merge, or when the lane is abandoned.
- **Scope changes are mirrored on the issue before they are sent.** A fixer
  cannot verify a mid-task `SendMessage`; it CAN verify an issue comment.
  Post the comment first, then send the message pointing at it (the fixer
  playbook says to check). Unmirrored additions are declined by design.
- **Dependabot PRs merge on real checks, no issue needed (maintainer,
  2026-09-07).** The PR-title issue-ref gate is a policy check this train
  applies to human PRs; a bump title can never carry a ref. Merge order: one
  at a time (each merge dirties the rest; dependabot rebases them itself);
  gate on Lint, Unit tests and every non-advisory check on the exact head;
  lint.yml and close-keywords.yml themselves skip "PR title", "PR body
  (advisory)" and "Close-keyword syntax" for dependabot (2026-09-09, refs
  #2714), so nothing needs hand-ignoring; hold anything red on a real check
  with a comment naming the check (2026-09-07: tsls 6 needs a Node-floor bump, biome
  fails the install test, vitest 5 fails four gates; a bump whose install
  script is pinned by `allowScripts` needs the pin moved in a maintainer
  commit on the bump branch). A major bump with peers (vitest + coverage-v8)
  lands together or not at all.
- **Detector, ratchet and governance-sweep authoring goes to Opus from
  round 1.** Their correctness lives in parsing edge cases, exactly where the
  smaller model loses: #2693 took two Sonnet rounds (~720k tokens) on a text
  scanner before the rail sent round 3 to Opus, which rewrote it on the AST
  and closed in two rounds.
- **Brief shape for a fixer.** Issue/PR number and head; the checked-out
  branch; the exact findings with file:line, the reviewer's probe to reproduce
  FIRST, and the remedy shape the maintainer chose; what to fold (net-count)
  and what stays out; the suites to run (named files + the mechanical
  governance selector + every tests/config file); the observability record to
  name; "no agents, foreground runs, one CI read, no monitors". Brief a
  reviewer with the PR number, the claims as the fixer stated them, and the
  attack angles that matter for THIS diff; ask for a verdict first.
- **Round routing.** Fix rounds that only apply a reviewer-prescribed remedy
  with quoted reds merge on green (CI read on the exact head, both required
  checks, mergeable state). Rounds that add mechanism, touch session or
  lifecycle semantics, or rewrite a guard get a fresh verify. Classify the
  round by its worst finding, not its count: a round whose findings are all
  contract (body text, docstrings, a record added WITH its test, a test
  added for an existing behaviour) merges on green — #2647 r2 is that shape;
  a round with one behaviour finding (a verdict, a guard direction, a
  lifecycle hook, a failsafe) gets the same-reviewer verify — #2649 r2 and
  #2654 r2. Say which in the fixer brief so the reviewer is not re-armed by
  reflex. A verify that
  reports a NEW defect triggers the round-count rail above.
- **Retargeting a PR's base does not re-arm CI.** `ci.yml` fires on
  `opened`/`synchronize`/`reopened`; `gh pr edit --base` is an `edited`
  event, so the required checks stay ABSENT and `ci-verdict` reports "absent,
  treating as pending" — exit 3, not 0; the "exit 0" first recorded on #2664
  was `$?` read after a `| tail`. After a retarget, push a commit or
  close/reopen. Read exit codes without a pipe. The merge loop is
  `node scripts/ci-verdict.mjs <pr> --wait <seconds>; echo $?` — 0 merge, 3
  still pending (re-arm the wait), anything else read the table. Never
  text-match the table for `failure`: advisory rows (PR body, Vale)
  print `failure` while the verdict is green, and on 2026-09-07 that stopped
  the #2692 loop on a green PR.
- **Maintainer trailing commits** are for intent-free deltas only (a literal
  NUL byte, a false comment, a missing PR-body heading); anything that changes
  what code MEANS goes through a fix round.
- **Mechanical-only verdict (2026-09-07).** When EVERY finding in a review or
  verify is intent-free — a PR-body census the reviewer corrected, an inverted
  body sentence, a heading, a literal, a comment — the orchestrator applies
  them as trailing commits and merges on green: no fixer resume, no re-verify.
  That is one resume saved per such PR. One finding that changes what code
  means, however small, makes it a fix round; a fix round that exists anyway
  carries the mechanical findings with it (#2693 r2 carried F3–F5). Borrowed
  from the auto-fix-mechanical rule in aromanarguello/roman-skills
  `final-review`; NOT borrowed from it: auto-fixing null checks, error
  handling or cleanup hooks, which change meaning.
- **Allocate the catalog number at MERGE, not at dispatch (2026-09-15).**
  AGENTS.md's defect-shape catalog is a markdownlint MD029 ordered list: the
  number is the list position, so dispatch-time reservations create a gap on
  branches whose holder has not merged. The orchestrator owns allocation; a
  lane may draft a shape but must not claim a number. At merge, insert or
  renumber the shape at the next valid sequential position and recheck the
  whole catalog. This prevents concurrent lanes from colliding without
  shipping a gap.
- **On a CROSS-REPOSITORY PR, `action_required` is not `absent` (2026-09-12).**
  A fork PR's workflow runs sit unstarted until a maintainer approves them, and
  `ci-verdict` correctly reports the required checks as absent and therefore
  pending. Absent because CI has not registered yet and absent because nobody
  approved the run look identical in the verdict table and are hours apart in
  remedy. Before treating a fork PR as "CI still coming", read the runs
  directly:
  `gh api "repos/<owner>/<repo>/actions/runs?head_sha=<sha>" --jq '.workflow_runs[] | "\(.id)\t\(.name)\t\(.status)\t\(.conclusion)"'`
  and approve each `action_required` run with
  `gh api -X POST repos/<owner>/<repo>/actions/runs/<id>/approve`. #2983 sat
  unapproved while the lane read it as a slow queue.
- **Read the advisory rows before merging, even though they never gate
  (2026-09-12).** The exit-code rule above is right and stays: never text-match
  the verdict table for `failure`, because advisory rows print `failure` on a
  green PR. But "does not gate" is not "carries no information", and filtering
  advisory rows out of your attention is a different mistake from filtering
  them out of the gate. `typos (advisory)` found a real defect in #2955's
  round-12 diff — a comment in which "reading" was misspelt — which the
  gating checks had no opinion about and which would otherwise have reached
  master. (The misspelling is described rather than reproduced here: quoting
  it verbatim makes this file itself red the typos lane, which is the same
  detector-versus-prose problem the testing rules already name.) Gate on the exit code; read the advisory failures on the exact head
  before the merge and dispose of each one (fix as a trailing commit, or say
  why it is noise).
- **`gh run rerun` replays the ORIGINAL merge commit; it does not pick up a
  moved base (2026-09-12).** A pull-request CI run tests `refs/pull/N/merge`,
  master merged into the branch. When master moves — say a fix for the very
  failure that red the lane just landed — rerunning the failed job re-runs the
  SAME merge commit, so the fix is not in the tree and the lane reds again
  identically. The log's checkout line is the proof and is worth reading every
  time: `HEAD is now at <sha> Merge <branch-sha> into <BASE-sha>`; if that base
  is not current master, the run tells you nothing about current master. This
  cost a false conclusion on 2026-09-12 — a lane red on `pi-lens-warmup-oneshot-*`
  after its fix had merged looked like the fix not working, and the base was one
  commit behind. Re-arm with
  `gh api -X PUT repos/<o>/<r>/pulls/<N>/update-branch` (or a push), never a
  rerun, whenever the reason to re-run is that the BASE changed. Same family as
  the retarget rule above: the event that re-runs CI must be one that rebuilds
  the merge ref.
- **A nondeterministic gate makes a green a sample, not a proof
  (2026-09-12).** The fixture-hygiene ratchet reds only when a leaky family
  actually loses the race, so two PRs on the SAME base can disagree: on
  2026-09-12 #2994 went green and #2997 red on identical master. Before merging
  on a green whose base is stale, ask whether the gate that matters is
  deterministic; if it is not, re-gate on a current base rather than bank the
  sample. The merged result runs against master, not against the tree that
  happened to pass.
- **Detection retrospective on every merged bug fix (2026-09-06).** The
  catalog records the CODE lesson of a bug (a shape, a screen, a guard). Before
  a bug-labelled lane's ledger row closes, the orchestrator also records the
  DETECTION lesson in one line: which verification layer caught it (external
  user, reviewer probe, CI job, governance sweep, install/compat/tool smoke,
  dogfood, release gate) and which layer SHOULD have caught it earlier and at
  what cost. If that layer does not exist, file it as an issue with the bug as
  its named recurrence — the same standard shapes are held to. The ledger
  carries a `caught by / should have been caught by` column. Record: #2587's
  manifest entry escaped the package for four releases; a second registration
  path masked it, so the shipped defect was foreign-tree adoption, not absence
  — and no check ever asked a real pi which SOURCE a skill came from. The
  shape lesson went into AGENTS.md the same day; the layer lesson (a witnessed
  real-pi pass asserting source and path, #2606) surfaced only because the
  maintainer brought an outside skill in, and the first runner's count-only
  row would have passed the broken release.
- **Harvest every reviewer's "Could not verify" and "Named output".** Those
  sections hold the structural insights the probes could not close (a
  runIf-conditional guard, a smoke section that never ran on a real runner, a
  detector's boundary map). Each entry becomes, before merge, one of: an
  issue, a ledger note with a reason, or a line in the PR body. Silence is not
  a disposition.
  When a Named output becomes an issue the orchestrator declines or defers,
  the ledger note names a DURABLE reason (a measured cost, a dependency, a
  design decision with its date), never "not now"; otherwise the same
  candidate is re-harvested at the next regroup rather than silently dropped.
- **Debt pass at the regroup (2026-09-07).** Before prioritising the next
  cycle, run the repo's own dead-code and duplication tools over the files
  changed since the last release tag (`git diff --name-only v<last>..origin/master`;
  `npx knip` uses the config in package.json, Sonar's duplication gate is the
  CI form): every reviewer's "Named output" that named a re-derived seam
  (#2694: the call-site scan hand-rolled in three sweeps) is what this pass
  finds across lanes that no single review can see. Findings become issues
  with the file list, never release blockers, and test-seam duplication is
  IN scope — "Test infrastructure — reuse before you write" in AGENTS.md is
  the standing rule, so the borrowed skill's "test duplication is often
  intentional" exclusion is not borrowed. (Shape from aromanarguello/roman-skills
  `techdebt`.)
  Within that changed-file list, weight candidates by commit frequency since
  the last tag (`git log --since=<last-tag-date> --name-only --pretty=format: |
  sort | uniq -c | sort -rn`) so the pass follows the real hot spots rather
  than every touched file equally. A FULL-repo debt pass (not the diff-scoped
  one) carries a coverage contract: one ledger row per subsystem (id, files,
  status) and the pass is not closed until every row is filled or skipped with
  a reason. A debt-pass subsystem worker reports at most TWO materially useful
  simplifications, each with the deletion test answered, drawn from six
  candidate shapes: scattered booleans or nullable fields that permit invalid
  combinations (a state machine or discriminated union); repeated assumptions
  about an object shape (one typed model); duplicated branching a small map,
  registry or reducer would remove; unclear state or behaviour ownership (a
  module boundary); repeated scans or lookups a better collection or index
  would remove; lifecycle, concurrency or async state whose representation
  permits stale or contradictory state. Never force an abstraction; boring
  local code that is already clear stays. This cap is for
  debt-pass dispatch only and never applies to PR review, where every finding
  from CRITICAL to NITPICK is reported.
- **Session retrospective before the regroup.** One ledger block: what the
  maintainer had to bring in from outside, why the process did not surface it,
  and where the lesson was routed (contract, playbook, skill, issue). The
  2026-09-06 entry: the autoqa witness/reachability rules and the release-QA
  layer came from a maintainer link, not from the train's own retrospective
  on #2587.
- **Review tier follows what the diff touches, never the priority label
  (2026-09-06).** The record: the two most dangerous regressions of that day
  came from p3 follow-ups — #2595 (a 125 s stall on an awaited path, a latent
  crash) and #2604 (broke offline installs in r2, broke `npm install` on
  Windows in r3) — and both were caught only by full review; the p3s where
  review found nothing were the ones touching no production code.
  - **Tier A — full adversarial review, any priority:** anything under
    `clients/`, `tools/`, `mcp/`, `scripts/`, `.github/`, or a package
    manifest / lockfile.
  - **Tier B — one scoped review pass, scope stated in the brief:** tests-only
    diffs that are not governance sweeps or ratchets (those are Tier A: a
    guard is production for the train).
  - **Tier C — no reviewer agent:** docs, comments, rename-only, data files.
    Orchestrator read plus CI on the exact head.
  A prescribed-remedy fix round stays "merge on green" in every tier.
- **Same-seam siblings batch into the open PR (2026-09-06).** When a review
  finds a sibling of the same shape on the same seam, it goes into the current
  PR as another round — reusing the fixer's context and the reviewer's probes
  — when all three hold: same dependent sweep, remedy prescribed rather than
  designed, and the PR is not on the critical path of an external or p1 fix.
  Otherwise file it with the sibling list and the reason. The record: #2598
  out of #2599 and #2593 out of #2594 each cost a fresh fixer spin-up plus a
  fresh review (and #2604 then needed three rounds under a review that was
  already armed on that file); #2603 out of #2595 and #2592 out of #2585 were
  rightly separate (a new matcher; seventeen per-seam reads). #2596 was filed
  as a follow-up and closed as a duplicate — pure waste.
- **Refill order** when the quota gate is open: p1 first, then the queued
  follow-ups in ledger order, then the program work (#2421 → #2416 → #2383/#195).

## Disposition tables

Verify reports and fixer handoffs end with a per-finding disposition table
(defined in AGENTS.md "Orchestrator rules" and `docs/pi-lens-reviewer.md`);
read the worst cell to route the round.

## Honesty rules

- A finding is real when a probe proves it; a fix is real when the same probe
  passes and the regression test was red first.
- `closes` vs `refs` follows delivery, not optimism; leftovers get an issue
  comment before anything closes.
- After merging a `refs #N` PR, VERIFY the issue: read `gh issue view N
  --comments` and confirm a comment names the remainder. If the PR in fact
  satisfied every acceptance criterion, close N crediting the PR; if a
  remainder exists but is unnamed, post it. A `refs` PR with no remainder
  comment is how #1968 and #2355 sat open for weeks after their fixes
  landed (found 2026-09-02).
- Report what ran, what was skipped, and what CI must still confirm.

## Common mistakes (scan at task start)

Each row cost a lane at least once; the prose above carries the record.

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Reading a CI verdict without checking the SHA it judged | `ci-verdict --wait` returned exit 0 for the PREVIOUS head seconds after a push (#2878 trailing, 2026-09-10); compare the verdict's SHA with `gh pr view --json headRefOid` before merging |
| Reporting "pushed" before `git log -1` shows the commit | Two trailing commits failed the pre-commit hook (changelog one-entry rule, unused vars) and the ledger/body already said pushed; verify the head, then write the row |
| Folding a worker's extra changelog fragment into an existing one | One fragment = one top-level entry (`rollup-changelog --check`); keep a second fragment separate or drop it |
| Accepting a worker's "pre-existing red on master" | Run the file on origin/master in YOUR environment before believing it; four workers reported env-specific reds as master reds (2026-09-10) |
| Letting a fix round enumerate cases instead of deriving the rule | #2877 took 7 rounds; the brief for a rule fix demands derivation from the source of truth (grammar table, measured host sequence) |
| Accepting a state-space table on its claims | Grep every test id in the table before accepting the round; #2877 r3 and #2868 r3 (2026-09-10) shipped 48–72-cell tables with zero real ids |
| Believing a worker's "N suites red on origin/master" without auditing its probe ENV | #3026's fixer pinned `TMPDIR` to the harness `.probe-home` and reported 16 unrelated suites red; the tree was green (2026-09-15). Ask for the A/B with the variable held fixed; the `tmpdirCollision` deny rule in `scripts/hooks/guard-bash.mjs` blocks the command |
| Merging a PR before its own CI has been read on the exact head | #3051 landed 20:05Z with the gitignore negation commit missing; `gitignore-tracked-shadow` redded on every open lane for ~30 min (#3055). `node scripts/ci-verdict.mjs <sha>` before every merge, admin merges included |
| Hand-triggering attempt 3 after a second infra kill | `ci-infra-kill-rerun.yml`'s classify job was gated `run_attempt == 1`, so it never covered the second kill on one head; #3048 and #3040 each needed a manual rerun (2026-09-15). The gate now covers attempt 2; a third kill is a hand rerun by design |
| Merging a workflow edit whose only executing lane is master-only | #3033 edited install-smoke's `pnpm-global`/`mise-repro` steps, both gated `!= 'pull_request'`; six cells failed on every master push for a day (#3043). Give the edited lane a PR-eligible cell, or run `gh workflow run <file> --ref <branch>` and quote the run id |
| Sending a governance-sweep brief to a Sonnet fixer | Two rounds cost 765k tokens / 459 tool uses on #3066 and 587k on round 1 alone (2026-09-15). A brief that adds or edits a `tests/support/sweep-kit.ts` registered-or-fail sweep goes to the strongest available fixer |
| Dispatching into a backend session window that cannot hold the brief | commandcode's undocumented 5-hour cap killed #2928's worker after 42 turns with uncommitted work and no `COMMIT_MSG.txt`, and gave #3045 r2's worker 0 turns (2026-09-16 00:07Z). Check the backend's cap and reset time before dispatch; re-route on reset (plegma #436) |
| Accepting a derived guard whose mutations are all neutered-guard rows | #3045 r1's guard accepted a junk marker and a substring launcher with M3/M4/M6 green. Demand one negative-population row: an input the guard must reject (#3075) |
| Merging a fold PR without mutating what the deleted sibling used to back | Four folds in one session each shipped a newly-sole predicate that was untested (#3064 F1, #3065 F3, #3066 F3, #3068 F2). Mutate every predicate the fold promoted, not only the new code |
| Accepting a runtime test as red-first evidence for a type-only defect | #3026's case could never red — `tsc` erased both changed lines and the emitted JS was byte-identical. The compile transcript on both `tsconfig.build.json` and `tsconfig.json` is the evidence (#3074) |
| Admitting a real `git show <sha>` in a test to read historical content | #3066 r1 ran it at MODULE SCOPE; CI checks out at depth 1, so the file would have collected zero tests including three pre-existing #525 cases. Commit the content as a fixture under `tests/fixtures/` |
| Letting a heavy governance test land without a measured peak RSS | `bounded-container-guard` landed at 9.2 GB on 2026-09-14 and drove the CI kill rate 7.1% → 30.4% in five days (#3058). The `worker-peak-rss` gate (#3062) now fails a `default`-project file over budget; keep it gating, not advisory (#3067) |
| Arming `plegma watch --next` after the lane already settled | The watch only sees settlements newer than itself; check `plegma_status` by handle first and process a done lane directly (three lanes sat settled for hours, 2026-09-10) |
| Pruning trees with `merge-base --is-ancestor` | Prune only trees whose branch is the head of the PR just merged (#2358's tree, 2026-09-06) |
| Retargeting a PR base and waiting for CI | `edited` does not fire ci.yml; push a commit or close/reopen |
| Reading `$?` after a pipe | `node scripts/ci-verdict.mjs <pr> --wait N; echo $?` on its own line |
| Text-matching the verdict table for `failure` | Key on the exit code; advisory rows print `failure` on green PRs (#2692) |
| Committing a worker tree with `git add -A` and a pathspec exclude | Check `git ls-files` for handoff files and scratch dirs before the commit; fold a second fragment (#2807, #2808, 2026-09-09) |
| Merging two green PRs that edit the same baseline or admission map in parallel | Serialise them and re-run that file's test on master between (#2816) |
| Reviewing a branch head that no longer carries master | Reviewer merges origin/master into the scratch checkout first; CONFLICTING is not reviewable (#2808 vs #2795) |
| Pushing docs, config or data straight to master without preflight | `npm run preflight` on the exact tree first; three master reds on 2026-09-09 |
| Nudging a capped small-model lane more than once | One continuation, then reassign to the strongest model (GLM lanes, 2026-09-09) |
| Waiting on CI for a bot-authored PR (github-actions nightly refresh) | A GITHUB_TOKEN push fires no `pull_request` run: required checks stay ABSENT forever; close/reopen the PR to fire them (#2801, 2026-09-09) |
| Leaving a design question to the fixer (where evidence comes from, which identity rule) | Decide it in the brief; #2900 oscillated three rounds (walker → findings → walker again) until round 4's brief fixed the evidence source (2026-09-10) |
| Guessing a lane's branch name when writing a brief | Read `gh pr view N --json headRefName` in the same command that builds the brief; plegma refused two dispatches on invented refs (#2908, #2898; 2026-09-10) |
| `git add -A -- . ':!<ignored file>'` in a chained command | The exclude pathspec on an IGNORED path makes `git add` exit 1 and the chain stops before the commit; use plain `git add -A` (ignored files never stage) and verify the index afterwards (2026-09-10, twice) |
| Treating a `ci-verdict --wait` exit as a CI verdict without reading it | Exit 70 = GitHub API unreachable; every armed wait died at once during two outages on 2026-09-10 — poll `https://api.github.com/` until 200, then re-arm one wait per PR |
| Merging a PR that arms a registry-membership guard without telling the other lanes | After #2924, every open PR that adds a formatter, LSP server or MCP tool needs a docs line in the same change; note it in the ledger and the next briefs (2026-09-10) |
| Judging master from the local checkout | `git fetch origin` and read `origin/master`; #2693 r1 reported a catalog row missing that had merged an hour earlier, and the orchestrator's own branch that morning was cut from a master six commits behind |
| Swapping reviewers between rounds | Same reviewer verifies; the probes and the mutation set are the continuity |
| Trusting the fixer's "CI green" | Read ci-verdict on the exact head SHA yourself; absent required checks are not green |
| A third patch-only round on one seam | Round-count rail: state-space table in the body first, Opus fixer |
| Merging a `refs` PR with no remainder comment | Post the remainder or close the issue crediting the PR |
| Dispatching independent agents one message at a time | All independent Agent calls in one message; the quota gate is read once before the batch |
| Resuming a fixer whose tree was reaped | Spawn a fresh fixer on the branch, or export `PILENS_HYGIENE_KEEP_AGENT_TREES=1` for the session up front |
| Sweeping a shape by grep-counting tokens | A ratchet reads the exact literal it governs (#2693: four sites counted, six real) |
| `npx <tool>@latest` inside the repo to measure something | It rewrote package-lock.json (108 deletions) on 2026-09-07; run one-off tools from a scratch prefix, and `git diff --stat` before every commit |
| `git add -A` in a worktree that links `node_modules` | The ignore rule `node_modules/` does not match a SYMLINK; #2703 committed one and broke the clean-clone install and the tracked-shadow test. `git add <paths>`, and `.gitignore` now says `node_modules` without the slash |
| `git worktree remove --force` on a tree whose `node_modules` is a symlink | Git follows the link and empties the shared checkout's install (twice on 2026-09-16, #2704 class; every other lane's build broke). `rm node_modules` first (unlink, never `rm -r`), then remove; mechanisation in the Bash hook is filed |
| Checking a branch out in the shared main tree for your own fix | Reviewers saw the checkout switch under them three times on 2026-09-07; use a throwaway `git worktree add` under the scratchpad, remove it after the push |
| `gh run rerun --failed` while the run is still in progress | GitHub refuses it; wait for the run to complete (poll `gh run view --json status`), then rerun, then re-read the verdict |
| Reading a failed job's log before its run completes | Empty output; the log is withheld until the whole run finishes |
| Treating a reviewer's prescription as the fix | It is a hypothesis: #2693 r2's blanked-slice remedy stayed green on `env: { PWD: cwd }`; the fixer's AST rule replaced it and the reviewer withdrew the prescription |
| `git add -A` from a worktree without the probe-home exclude | 978 `.probe-home/npm-cache` blobs reached master in a direct push (2026-09-09, #2843); the user-level `commit-index-check` hook now denies it — keep the exclude anyway |
| Ignoring a red advisory row on a PR that changes what the lane runs | #2833 merged with `Unit tests Windows (advisory)` red on its own head; master carried the red until #2842. Read that row like a gate when the diff touches the lane's script, step or executed files |
| Restarting the plegma daemon under systemd with the default PATH | Backend detection is a PATH walk in the daemon process; 5 of 10 backends vanished and every Luna/GLM brief was rejected `Unknown model` (plegma#375). Set `Environment=PATH=…npm-global/bin…` in a drop-in and read `daemon.out`'s `backends:` line after ANY restart |
| Polling `plegma_list` every turn | 68 calls, 194 KB of context in one session for no decision. Arm one background `plegma wait <handle>` per lane in the dispatch turn; `plegma_list` only at reconnect and to consume `done` handles |
| Running `node ../../scripts/<x>` from a worktree | The path resolves against the worktree's parent, not the repo; two CI waits exited at once with the wrapper's exit 0 (2026-09-10). Inside a worktree the scripts are at `scripts/`; read the wait's output file before trusting an exit code |
| Appending a worker's body section keyed on an exact heading level | The worker wrote `# Round 7`, the append keyed on `## Round 7`, and the PR body shipped without the round (#2846 v7). `grep` the published body for the section before reporting it landed |
| Pushing an orchestrator round without `npm run fmt:check` on the whole tree | #2853's merge round redded oxfmt on two trimmed lists (2026-09-10). fmt:check is the last command before any push, orchestrator rounds included |
| Running a governance suite in the main checkout after merges without rebuilding | Vitest loads compiled `.js`; a stale build makes the run fail closed (or worse, test old code). `npm run build` before any test run in a checkout that has moved |
| Accepting a lifecycle round on `-t`-only mutation reds | #2853 r6/r7 quoted reds that only reproduced under `-t`; nine awaits never returned whole-file (#2859). Whole-file mutation runs are the acceptance shape (AGENTS.md round-routing) |
| Sending a scope `note` to a worker about to finish | The #2854 r2 worker settled before the note was read; the round shipped without H2/M1. Check `plegma_status` first; a worker with no turns left gets a new round, not a note |
| Rewriting a PR body's narrative without re-reading the `.changelog/` fragment | The fragment kept the retracted round-1 story after the body moved on to a different remedy (#3155 r2); re-read the fragment on every body rework, not just the body |
