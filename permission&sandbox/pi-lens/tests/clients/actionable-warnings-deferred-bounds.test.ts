/**
 * #2504 review round 2 — the DEFERRED off-hook actionable-warnings loop.
 *
 * #2504 moved the cold-cache LSP fresh-pull loop off the awaited `turn_end`
 * hook. Two defects came with it:
 *
 *  - F2. The deferred report is stamped with the ORIGINATING turn's
 *    `turnIndex`/`projectSeq` and may land up to 60 s (many turns) later,
 *    where it overwrote a NEWER report. `agent_end` then read that cache
 *    back, saw `project_seq_mismatch`, and silently skipped the autofix pass;
 *    `lens_diagnostics` re-served the same stale delta.
 *  - F3. The loop had effectively ONE bound. Its `signal` was the COMPLETED
 *    turn's `ctx.signal`, which `index.ts` clears from the ambient slot in its
 *    `finally` and which therefore never fires; the only live bound was a 60 s
 *    wall deadline checked BETWEEN files. A wedged `getDiagnostics` was
 *    unbounded, the loop kept opening files after `turn_end` returned and
 *    after the LSP idle reset, a `session_shutdown` mid-loop hit the #234
 *    spawn-at-teardown shape, and a second deferral simply overwrote the
 *    module-level handle, leaving the first loop running and unstoppable.
 *
 * The LSP SERVICE is faked here, but `resetLSPService` is the real one
 * (`importOriginal` below): the session_shutdown tests drive production's own
 * teardown entry point, not a stand-in for it.

 * per-round-trip timeout fires", i.e. red on an 8 s window, with no change in

/**
 * #2504 review round 7 (F2/F3) — round 6 fixed the ADVISORY text to read
 * `publishResult.report` (the MERGED report) instead of the pre-merge
 * `report` this turn assembled, but nothing pinned it: reverting that one
 * line back to `report` left the existing suite green. The TELEMETRY event
 * right below it (`logActionableWarningsEvent`'s `metadata.unsuppressed`)
 * still read the pre-merge `report` even after round 6 -- a rescued
 * deferred finding was correctly advised but logged as worth 0, and
 * `scripts/analyze-pi-lens-logs.mjs` sums that field. This test drives the
 * real `handleTurnEnd` path (not a hand-fed report) for both halves: a
 * deferred delivery in turn N, then a turn N+1 with no new findings of its
 * own, and checks both surfaces the merge is supposed to feed.
