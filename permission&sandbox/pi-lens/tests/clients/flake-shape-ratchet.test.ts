/**
 * Flake-shape ratchet — #2547.
 *
 * Three deflake PRs in two days (#2531 alone fixed three shared-slot races)
 * and nothing counted the contention surface those PRs kept fixing, so the
 * set only grew. This ratchet counts it: `tests/support/flake-shape-scan.ts`
 * runs four detectors over every `tests/**\/*.test.ts` file —
 *
 * 1. `real-process-spawn` — a real child process (`child_process` import,
 *    `execFileSync`/`spawnSync`/`execSync`, a support spawn-helper call, or a
 *    spawn whose argv mentions `vitest`).
 * 2. `elapsed-time-assertion` — a DELTA of two clock reads flowing into a
 *    numeric matcher (`toBeLessThan`/`toBeGreaterThan`/…).
 * 3. `raw-timer-wait` — a raw `setTimeout`/`setInterval` wait outside a
 *    `vi.useFakeTimers()` scope.
 * 4. `ungoverned-wait-for` — a `vi.waitFor` call outside a fake-timer scope.
 *
 * `FLAKE_SHAPE_BASELINE` (`tests/support/flake-shape-baseline.json`) is
 * today's population, content-keyed as `file → count` per detector — the
 * exact floor, kept in lockstep with the live scan, not a one-way ratchet
 * that only ever tightens on its own. The ratchet is TWO-SIDED and fails on:
 *
 * - a NEW file the scan flags that the baseline does not name, in any
 *   detector;
 * - an allowlisted file whose count in a detector RISES above its pinned
 *   value;
 * - an allowlisted file whose count in a detector FALLS below its pinned
 *   value — a stale ceiling. Left unpinned, a pinned-5/live-2 file can
 *   regrow to 4 new instances of the flake shape without ever tripping the
 *   RISES check above (2 < 5, then 4 < 5): the pin silently re-admits
 *   everything the improvement burned down. Every other ratchet in this repo
 *   refuses a stale entry the same way (`single-flight-ratchet.test.ts`,
 *   `sweep-kit.ts`'s `auditRegistry`) — a fall is fixed by editing the
 *   baseline down to the live count, not left to drift.
 *
 * Admission of a genuinely NEW entry (a new file, or a risen count in an
 * existing one) is a two-part gate, both required: the file carries a
 * `// flake-shape: <detector> — <reason>` header naming why a mock is not
 * faithful, AND the file is listed in `vitest.config.ts`'s
 * `wallClockBudgetInclude` project (so it runs in the fully serialized
 * lane). `ADMITTED_AFTER_BASELINE` below is the running list of entries
 * admitted this way since the baseline was minted.
 *
 * #1767's `tests/clients/runtime-session.test.ts` (a real recurring flake,
 * fixed with `vi.waitFor` timeouts and a wider `describe`/`it` budget, not a
 * raw clock delta, a raw timer, or a spawn) was checked by hand against all
 * three detectors while writing this ratchet and matches NONE of them — it
 * is the #1767 vi.waitFor/testTimeout contention-budget flake shape, a real
 * but DIFFERENT shape than the three this ratchet counts, so it correctly
 * does not appear in the baseline. Recorded here rather than silently
 * absent, so a future reader does not conclude the file was missed.
