/**
 * #1217 regression: `pruneDeadInstances` (clients/instance-reaper.ts) staged
 * the machine-global `instances.json` at a hand-rolled
 * `${target}.tmp-${process.pid}` instead of going through `atomic-write.ts`,
 * so it never inherited the #1205 per-call staging fix.
 *
 * Two concurrent prunes in one process computed the identical staging path,
 * both wrote into it, and the first rename published that inode while the
 * second was still writing — publishing a torn `instances.json`. This store
 * degrades a parse failure to empty (`readInstanceRegistry`), so a tear drops
 * EVERY registered instance rather than the one entry being pruned.
 *
 * Concurrency here is by design, not exceptional: `instance-registry.ts`'s
 * `getResourceFootprint` fires `prunePids(...)` fire-and-forget while the
 * reaper runs its own sweep, with nothing serializing the two.
 *
 * Payload sizes are mismatched (many instances vs few) so a hybrid is
 * detectable, and the file is asserted to parse AND to be one of the two
 * intended states — a truncated JSON object that happens to still parse would
 * otherwise pass. Nothing branches on `process.platform`.

/**
 * Tracks the currently-awaited `pruneDeadInstances` call(s) so `afterEach` can

 * (#1629).
 *
 * `pruneDeadInstances` reads `process.env.PI_LENS_HOME` fresh on every call
 * (via `getGlobalPiLensDir`, clients/file-utils.ts) rather than once per test.
 * Vitest's per-test timeout does not cancel in-flight async work — it only
 * races a timer against the test's promise and reports failure when the timer
 * wins, while the test body keeps running in the background. So a test that
 * times out mid-loop leaves its `for` loop still executing: the next
 * iteration reads `PI_LENS_HOME` again, but by then this file's `afterEach` +
 * the next test's `beforeEach` have already repointed it at the NEXT test's
 * temp dir, and the zombie write lands there instead — failing the next
 * test's `stageLeftovers()` assertion with the PRIOR test's litter (observed
 * 2026-08-19 on CI, reproduced locally under contention: e.g.
 * `instances.json.tmp-35960-0-36` appearing in the wrong test's directory).
 * Awaiting the last-known in-flight promise here closes that window: the next
 * `beforeEach` cannot run until this one's zombie work has settled.
