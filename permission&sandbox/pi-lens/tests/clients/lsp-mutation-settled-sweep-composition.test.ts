/**
 * #2465 — composition of #2449's observational mutation net with #2450's
 * `workspace/applyEdit` bridge fallback.
 *
 * Each PR is correct alone. Composed, two hand-off rules decide whether the
 * `agent_settled` sweep tells the truth about an LSP-applied write:
 *
 * 1. `recordMutationThroughSeam`'s `noteMutationHandled(filePath)` must sit
 *    OUTSIDE the `if (entry.deferAutofix !== false)` guard. The LSP bridge
 *    fallback passes `deferAutofix: false` — not because the write is
 *    unimportant, but because formatting an LSP-applied edit is not that
 *    seam's job. Fold the mark into the guard and every fallback write
 *    becomes drift no tool call explains.
 * 2. `bookkeepLspMutation`'s DIRECT (deps-threaded) branch must call
 *    `noteMutationHandled` itself. It bypasses the bridge entirely, so it
 *    inherits nothing from rule 1, and without it every `lsp_navigation`
 *    rename is reported as drift.
 *
 * Both are invisible to either PR's own tests: #2449's suite never drives an
 * LSP write, and #2450's suite never runs the sweep. So this file drives the
 * REAL production write path (`applyWorkspaceEdit`, which writes the bytes
 * AND bookkeeps through `recordLspMutation`) and then the REAL
 * `runObservedSettledSweep`, wired with the same `isRecordable` helper
 * `index.ts`'s `runObservedSettledSweepSafely` threads.
 *
 * ## Why every case carries a CONTROL file
 *
 * "The sweep reported zero drift" is worthless on its own — a sweep that
 * never ran, or one whose ledger was never seeded, reports zero for
 * everything. Each case therefore tracks a SECOND file that nothing recorded,
 * rewritten by the same amount in the same window, and asserts the same sweep
 * pass DID report it. Zero for the LSP file is only meaningful next to one for
 * the control.
