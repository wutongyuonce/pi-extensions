/**
 * #2722 — a managed npm LSP server whose transport-required marker cannot be
 * read back through a pipe.
 *
 * intelephense has no CLI: its entry calls `createConnection()` unconditionally
 * and throws, and Node prints the offending source line ahead of the message.
 * The bundle is one ~4 MB minified line, so the marker #208's rescue matches on
 * lands at byte 4,154,741 of a 4,423,356-byte stderr — while Node drops
 * everything past 1 MiB of a PIPED stderr when the child exits. The bytes never
 * leave the child, so no `checkArgs` value can produce a verdict, and
 * `installNpmTool`'s cleanup branch deleted every successful install.
 *
 * Two guarantees are pinned here:
 *
 * 1. `verification: "package-entry"` verifies the install from the tree on
 *    disk with NO spawn at all — the same class of evidence the `archive`
 *    strategy already accepts through `treeMarker`.
 * 2. A probe that ran to completion with the transport matcher ARMED, never
 *    matched, and a TRUNCATED prefix of the output is INCONCLUSIVE, not a
 *    verdict: `onInconclusive` fires and the ledger records
 *    `installer-verification-inconclusive`, so a caller keeps the install.
 *
 * Guarantee 2's fixture is the real defect, not a double that hands the seam a
 * marker: the child genuinely writes the marker to stderr and Node genuinely
 * loses it (AGENTS.md test-authoring screen 1).
