/**
 * Regression: read-guard keyed its reads/edits maps on the raw file path, so a
 * read recorded under one separator/casing form (e.g. the slash-normalized path
 * that LSP-expanded and search-tool reads produce) was invisible to an edit
 * checked under another (the Read tool's OS-native backslashes on Windows). The
 * guard then reported `zero_read` and blocked the edit even though the file had
 * been read — repeatedly, in a real session (see read-guard.log: reads logged
 * with `C:/…` forward slashes, the blocking edit with `C:\\…` backslashes).
 *
 * The fix canonicalizes every map key through `normalizeFilePath`. These tests
 * pin that record and lookup agree regardless of the separator/casing the two
 * call sites happen to use.
