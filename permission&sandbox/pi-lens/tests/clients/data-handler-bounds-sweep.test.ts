/**
 * #3383 — every stream `data` handler in the shipped trees is registered with
 * the bound that keeps its accumulation finite.
 *
 * ## The recurrence this guards
 *
 * #3375: `safeSpawnAsync`'s chunk handler grew one JS string per chunk with no
 * ceiling, V8 refused the next concatenation with `RangeError: Invalid string
 * length`, and because that throw is raised inside a `data` handler — delivered
 * to the process, never to the awaiting caller — it terminated the Pi host (Pi
 * 0.86.1, 2026-09-22). #3375 fixed ONE seam. #3383's sweep then found nine more
 * accumulators in `data` handlers that never reach that seam: two forked-worker
 * pipes, the unref'd process-table collector, two installer interpreter probes,
 * four newline-framing buffers. Every one of them was the identical shape, and
 * nothing in the tree could have told a reviewer that adding the tenth was a
 * defect.
 *
 * So this sweep is a POPULATION pin, not a heuristic: it finds every
 * `on("data"` / `once("data"` registration under `clients/`, `mcp/`, `tools/`
 * and `index.ts`, and requires each FILE to be registered below with how many
 * it has and what bounds them. A new handler in a registered file trips the
 * count; a handler in a new file trips the registry; a bound whose evidence
 * disappears from the file trips the evidence check.
 *
 * PER-NEEDLE STRING POLICY. The handler needle's own evidence IS a string
 * literal (`.on("data"`), so the site scan strips COMMENTS but keeps string
 * contents (`strings: "keep"`) — under the default policy `"data"` blanks to
 * `""` and the sweep matches nothing at all, which is how the first draft of
 * this file reported a clean zero across 370 files. The self-test below pins
 * that direction. Bound EVIDENCE is matched on the default strip instead, where
 * string contents are blanked too: a bound named in a comment or a message
 * string must never satisfy the evidence check.
 *
 * What it deliberately does NOT do is judge boundedness mechanically. "This
 * `+=` has a ceiling" is a data-flow question a line scan cannot answer (the
 * bound can be a constant three lines up, a ring buffer's `shift`, a sink
 * object's own invariant, or the absence of retention altogether), and a
 * detector that guessed would either miss the real shape or fire on every
 * healthy handler. The registry makes the human verdict explicit and dated
 * instead — which is the same trade `tests/clients/…-sweep` files already make
 * across this repo.
