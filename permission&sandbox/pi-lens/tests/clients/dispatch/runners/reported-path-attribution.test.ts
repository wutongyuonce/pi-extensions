/**
 * #3278 — ONE seam answers "is this reported diagnostic about the file I
 * dispatched for?" for every runner:
 * `pathsEqual(path.resolve(<the cwd the tool RAN in>, reported), absTarget)`.
 *
 * Every cell enters through the REAL `createDispatchContext` + `dispatchForFile`
 * + `RunnerRegistry`: the defect is about the relationship between the
 * DISPATCHER's spelling of the file and the TOOL's, and a parser called
 * directly with a hand-made target cannot show it. The project root is always
 * NESTED two levels inside the temp dir and is never `process.cwd()`, so a
 * spelling that is relative to the runner cwd resolves to a DIFFERENT file
 * under the no-base `path.resolve` this change deletes.
 *
 * Recurrence prevented, per direction:
 *
 * - DROPPED (#209 / #3277): the tool's spelling of the edited file differs from
 *   the dispatcher's, the local compare drops every line for that file, and a
 *   run with a real finding is reported clean (or degrades to #1816's
 *   unparseable-output path). Reproduced from upstream source for
 *   `golangci-lint`, whose `PathPrettifier` OVERWRITES `Pos.Filename` with
 *   `filepath.Rel(basePath, …)` before the JSON printer sees it (v1.64.8
 *   `pkg/result/processors/path_prettifier.go:31` + `path_relativity.go:43`).
 * - OVER-MERGED: a DIFFERENT file's finding is attributed to the edited one.
 *   Reproduced from upstream source for `cue-vet`, whose locations are printed
 *   relative to the vet cwd with a `./` prefix (v0.11.0
 *   `cue/errors/errors.go:586-596`), so an imported package's file that merely
 *   SHARES the touched file's basename matched the old
 *   `path.posix.basename(...) === fileName` compare.
 * - CASE: a case-variant spelling must be ONE file exactly where the
 *   filesystem says it is, and two files where it does not — measured, never
 *   assumed from `process.platform`.
 *
 * The other eight members are handed the absolute target as argv and echo it
 * back (MEASURED for gcc 15.2.0 on this host; read from upstream for the rest —
 * see the PR's premise table), so for them the fold is behaviour-preserving
 * TODAY and these cells say so rather than feeding a spelling the tool never
 * emits (#2432: a double that mirrors the assumption proves nothing). Their
 * per-member proof is `tests/config/reported-path-attribution-sweep.test.ts`
 * plus the two mutation directions of the shared predicate.
 *
 * `gleam-check` is the ELEVENTH member and the one this file could not cover
 * when it was written (#3285): its reported spelling arrives inside
 * codespan_reporting's `┌─` locus gutter, an `endsWith` was tolerating that
 * gutter, and #3284 had no captured gleam output to establish the gutter's shape
 * from. Its cells feed a REAL upstream-rendered vector
 * (`tests/fixtures/gleam-codespan/`), so the fold is proven against gleam's own
 * renderer rather than against a guess at it.
