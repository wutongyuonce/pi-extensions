/**
 * #2691 ratchet (AGENTS.md defect shape 40): a linter/formatter runner that
 * computes `ctx.cwd` for its availability probe and its config-detection
 * helper, then spawns the ACTUAL lint/analysis process without passing that
 * same `cwd`, so the child resolves project config (or, for psscriptanalyzer,
 * a settings file) against the extension host's `process.cwd()` instead of the
 * project being linted — while the runner's own `hasXConfig(ctx.cwd)` gate
 * says the project config was found.
 *
 * #1731 fixed this shape for sqlfluff BY SYMBOL and missed five more instances
 * that a shape-based sweep found while fixing #2691's reported yamllint case:
 * ruff, spellcheck/typos, psscriptanalyzer, oxlint and shellcheck. A
 * symbol-grep for the next tool name will miss the next instance the same way,
 * so this sweeps the SHAPE across every runner at once.
 *
 * ## What this file is, and what it is not
 *
 * The detection itself lives in `tests/support/spawn-cwd-scan.ts` and is
 * specified cell by cell in `tests/support/spawn-cwd-scan.test.ts` — one named
 * fixture per cell of PR #2693's "Detector state space (round 3)" table (call-
 * site kind × where a `cwd` token can sit), plus one per node type the
 * TypeScript grammar lets own a declaration. THIS file is the integration
 * assertion: it runs that scan over the live tree.
 *
 * The split is the round-3 lesson. Rounds 1 and 2 had only the live-tree run,
 * which can assert nothing about the cells today's tree does not occupy — so
 * round 1 shipped a detector that read argument one as the options object
 * (missing one of the six defects its own red block claimed to prove), and
 * round 2 shipped one that read a comment or a string value inside the braces
 * as a passed cwd, and whose wrapper rule never followed `helm-lint.ts`'s
 * `lintChart` or `helm-render.ts`'s `renderAndValidate`. Both went green here
 * the whole time.
 *
 * ## The three rules, in one line each
 *
 * 1. PRESENCE — a site's options literal names `cwd` and the value is usable
 *    (not `undefined`/`null`/`""`/`process.cwd()`).
 * 2. ORIGIN (#2777) — that value traces back to `resolveToolCwd` (or the
 *    `resolveRunnerCwd`/`resolveFormatterCwd` wrappers), imported from the
 *    shared seam rather than named like it.
 * 3. WRAPPERS — a same-file function is a spawn-routing wrapper when a spawn's
 *    `cwd` resolves to one of its OWN parameters, and then its CALLERS are the
 *    sites the first two rules are applied to.
 *
 * All three are answered off the real AST (`@ast-grep/napi`, the same
 * dependency `tests/support/availability-gate.ts` uses), never off text.
 *
 * ## Scope
 *
 * The population is every spawn-bearing `.ts` file under `clients/`, `tools/`,
 * `mcp/` and `index.ts` — not just `clients/dispatch/runners/`. Both rules are
 * enforced over all of it.
 *
 * ## What the scan cannot see, and what closes it here
 *
 * The scan recognises a spawn by the callee's simple name — `safeSpawnAsync(`
 * and `o.safeSpawnAsync(`. Three spellings therefore occupy NO site at all,
 * and because a site that is never counted also never moves the pinned
 * population, none of them would red anything on its own (round-4 R3-F2):
 *
 *   1. an ALIASED import — `import { safeSpawnAsync as spawn } from …`,
 *   2. `safeSpawnAsync.call(...)` / `.apply(...)`,
 *   3. `Reflect.apply(safeSpawnAsync, …)`.
 *
 * All three have zero occurrences today, and the last test in this file
 * ASSERTS that, so the bound is fail-safe rather than merely documented: the
 * first one written reds here, naming the file, instead of quietly becoming
 * an uncounted spawn. (A namespace import is already covered — `calleeName`
 * reads `ns.safeSpawnAsync(...)` through the member expression.)
 *
 * ## Adding a spawn
 *
 * A tool PRESENCE/VERSION probe is not one of these: call `probeToolAsync`
 * (#2894) and it is neither a site nor a row, because that seam owns the
 * no-cwd contract for the whole class. Everything else follows the rule below.
 *
 * A new child spawn that passes a seam-resolved `cwd` costs one number:
 * `EXPECTED_DIRECT_SITES` (or `EXPECTED_WRAPPER_SITES`) moves by one, which is
 * where a reviewer sees the spawn was added. A new child spawn that does NOT
 * — no cwd, or a cwd from somewhere other than the seam — costs a ROW in one
 * of the three tables below, with a reason true of THAT site. Bumping a
 * number is never the way to admit a non-conforming spawn: the audits below
 * key every flagged site by its enclosing symbol, its call text and its cwd
 * expression, so an unadmitted one is reported by name (round-4 v3-F3, where
 * a new cwd-less spawn rode in on a colliding key and only the count moved).

/**
 * The exact population, measured 2026-09-10. These are pinned, not floored:
 * round 2 declared an emptiness floor of 25 against 58 live sites, and a floor
 * that loose is one-sided — it catches a sweep that goes dead but not one that
 * quietly stops SEEING sites. Reverting `spawnPs` to positional arguments, or
 * reintroducing round 1's wrapper blindness, each drops three or more sites
 * with every remaining site still conforming, so a floor stays green while the
 * ratchet's reach shrinks (round-2 review F3).
 *
 * They pin REACH, never conformance: see "Adding a spawn" in the header for
 * what a non-conforming new site costs instead.
 *
 * #2894 moved 20 direct sites (136 -> 117) and 3 wrapper sites off this scan
 * by folding every `--version`/presence probe onto `safe-spawn.ts`'s
 * `probeToolAsync`, which is not a spawn NAME the scan recognises, so a file
 * whose only child was a probe leaves the population entirely (76 -> 73 before `tool-probe.ts` itself joins it:
 * `dispatch/dispatcher.ts`, `dispatch/runners/utils/candidate-probe.ts`,
 * `security-scan-client.ts`). That is reach TRADED, not lost: the population
 * filter reads each file's CONTENT, so the moment any of those three writes a
 * `safeSpawnAsync(` again the file re-enters and its site is checked — and the
 * one cwd decision they used to make 23 times over is now made once, inside
 * `probeToolAsync`, where this file admits it by name.

 * ## The three tables, and what each one means

 * implementation), which is how a table stops being auditable (v3-F5).
 *
 * - {@link NO_CWD_EXEMPTION_ROWS} — the site passes no cwd, and the child has
 *   no project to resolve anything against: a `--version` probe, a
 *   `which`/`where` lookup, an install into a global tool directory.
 * - {@link ORIGIN_ADMISSION_ROWS} — the site passes a real cwd that the scan
 *   cannot trace to the seam: the wrapper's own parameter (its callers are the
 *   checked sites), a probe closure's parameter, or a directory deliberately
 *   derived from the file or project boundary.
 * - {@link MIGRATION_WORKLIST_ROWS} — the honest reason is "this should move
 *   onto `resolveToolCwd`". Not an exemption: a ratchet. Each row names its
 *   issue, and {@link WORKLIST_CEILING} can only ever be lowered.

 * - `@n` disambiguates the last case the content cannot: two byte-identical
