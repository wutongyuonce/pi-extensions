/**
 * LSP↔linter dispatch-coverage guard (#209).
 *
 * Catches a subtler sibling of the dead-runner class: a `smart-default` linter
 * (one tool-policy.ts says runs with built-in defaults, no config needed) that
 * shares a `mode:"fallback"` primary dispatch group with the `lsp` runner. In a
 * fallback group the first success wins, so once the language server installs
 * and handshakes, the LSP succeeds and the dedicated linter is **silently
 * suppressed** — dropping rules the generic LSP never emits (yamllint style,
 * stylelint, hadolint best-practices, htmlhint, …). `shell`/`fish`/`powershell`/
 * `prisma` already pair the LSP with their linter via `mode:"all"`; this test
 * enforces that consistency for every smart-default linter.
 *
 * Type-checker/compiler pairs (python lsp+pyright, cxx lsp+cpp-check, etc.) are
 * intentionally fallback — running two type-checkers is redundant — and contain
 * no smart-default linter, so they are not flagged.
