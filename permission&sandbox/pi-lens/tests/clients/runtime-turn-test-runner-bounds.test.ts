/**
 * #2522 review round 2/3 — the deferral must not become a livelock.
 *
 * The review's own measurement is the proof this is required, not
 * hypothetical: editing `clients/runtime-turn.ts` resolves
 * `tests/index-integration.test.ts` through the `related` strategy, and that
 * file takes 26 393 ms — MORE than the whole 20 000 ms batch budget, on its
 * own. Deferring it puts it first in the next batch, where it is cut again at
 * 20 s, and again, forever: 20 s of spawned vitest burnt every single turn,
 * with the target never finishing and never being reported.
 *
 * A target that has already outlived the budget `TEST_RUNNER_MAX_DEFERRALS`
 * times is therefore retired from turn-end selection with a counted
 * degradation naming it, rather than carried indefinitely.
 *
 * Round 3, F1: the retirement has to OUTLIVE THE TURN to be a retirement.
 * Round 2's retire branch logged, counted, and `continue`d — leaving no record
 * anywhere — so the candidate loop below it re-resolved the very same file
 * through `related` in the SAME turn and ran it with a fresh (undefined)
 * attempt count. Steady state was a 3-turn cycle: cut, cut, "retire", run,
 * cut, cut, "retire", run — the slow suite spawned and killed on every single
 * turn, the `--lens-guard` clean branch never reached, and the deferral
 * advisory delivered every turn. The fixtures below therefore seed the slow
 * suite's COMPANION SOURCE into the worklist, which is what makes the
 * candidate loop re-resolve it exactly as production does.

 *
 *  I1 a foreign-session entry is never destroyed by a write — foreign entries
 *     are filtered at SELECTION only;
 *  I2 every `deferredTargets` write MERGES against the live record;
 *  I3 `attempts` accumulates across turns and actually reaches the cap;
 *  I5 a carried entry rejected only by the per-turn cap stays on the list.
 *
 * (I4 — cut vs complete decided by the dispatch-time stamp rather than by
