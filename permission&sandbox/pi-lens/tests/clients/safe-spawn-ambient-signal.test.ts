/**
 * #197 — `safeSpawnAsync` defaults to the ambient turn abort signal.
 *
 * The lifecycle handlers publish pi's `ctx.signal` via `setAmbientAbortSignal`,
 * so dispatches that don't thread their own signal still cancel when the agent
 * is interrupted. These tests pin the defaulting/precedence/clearing behaviour
 * via the deterministic early-abort path (an already-aborted signal resolves
 * without spawning a real process).

	// cap trips on the parent's first read. A child that takes the default

/**
 * #3375 round 3 (review finding M3384-2) — the POSIX process-group teardown arm,
 * proven with a REAL child because nothing else reaches it.
 *
 * `killTree` picks its group branch on `posixProcessGroup && ownsChildPid`, and
 * `ownsChildPid` is `isOwnLiveChild(child.pid, …)`, which reads
 * `/proc/<pid>/status` and compares `PPid` to this process. A fabricated pid can
 * never satisfy that, so the mocked-child suites
 * (`safe-spawn-kill-failure.test.ts`) exercise only the NON-group branch: the
 * group `SIGTERM` send, its direct-child fallback, and the group escalation are
 * unreachable there. Measured before this test was written — a real child on
 * this host takes the group branch and the first send really is
 * `process.kill(-pid, "SIGTERM")`.
 *
 * Both kill seams are spied to refuse, so the child must be one that ENDS ON ITS
 * OWN: it writes past the cap and exits, and nothing here can leave a process
 * running even though every signal fails.
