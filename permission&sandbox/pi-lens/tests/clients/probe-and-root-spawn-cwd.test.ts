/**
 * #2894 — the two spawn-cwd classes that used to be decided site by site.
 *
 * Recurrence this file prevents (AGENTS.md defect shape 40, "a tool root
 * resolved at a different seam than its child spawn", and the #2872 sweep's
 * admission tables going unauditable):
 *
 * 1. PROBES. 23 availability/version spawns each decided "no cwd" in their own
 *    words, and the sweep carried 23 sentences a reviewer had to re-read one
 *    at a time. `probeToolAsync` owns that decision now, and it STRIPS a cwd
 *    rather than merely omitting one — the failure mode being closed is a
 *    probe that quietly acquires a project directory through an options
 *    object someone widened, which is invisible to the type alone.
 *
 * 2. HAND-DERIVED ROOTS. `ruff-client.ts` computed
 *    `cwd ?? path.dirname(absolutePath)` while `dispatch/runners/ruff.ts`
 *    used `resolveRunnerCwd` for the same file — two derivations for one root,
 *    which `tool-policy.ts`'s own contract says must agree. Measured on
 *    pre-#2894 code, with the caller passing the workspace root and the file
 *    in a nested package that ships its own `pyproject.toml`:
 *
 *      ruff check --output-format json …  cwd=<workspace root>
 *
 *    i.e. the nested package's config never applied. `rust-clippy.ts` had the
 *    same shape with its own `findNearestContaining(dirname(file),
 *    ["Cargo.toml"])` walk, uncapped by the dispatch root.
 *
 * Everything below drives the REAL production paths — the real dispatcher
 * availability probe, the real `RuffClient.fixFileAsync`, the real runner
 * `run()` — and fakes only the process boundary (`safeSpawnAsync`), which is
 * where the child's cwd is observed. A real spawn would show nothing extra
 * and would need `flake-shape-ratchet` admission for a shape the fix does not
 * require.
