/**
 * #1969: the liveness probe only sends a method the server advertised.
 *
 * `clientPingLiveness` (#1277) hardcoded `workspace/symbol` because it needs no
 * open document, and counted a `MethodNotFound` reply as proof of life. The
 * round-trip reasoning is sound. The hardcoded method is not: a server that
 * does not implement it logs an error for every probe. ast-grep's tower_lsp
 * backend wrote "got a 'workspace/symbol' request, but it is not implemented"
 * on each one, and its `code=1` deaths clustered after them.
 *
 * The fix picks the probe from the server's advertised capabilities, best
 * first: `workspace/symbol`, then `textDocument/documentSymbol` on an open
 * document, then `textDocument/hover` on an open document, then nothing.
 * ast-grep advertises `hoverProvider` (docs/servercapabilities.md:53), so it
 * keeps a real round-trip rather than falling to the last rung.
 *
 * Assertions are on the WIRE — which method the client actually sends — not on
 * an internal branch, because "does not provoke an error in the server" is a
 * statement about what leaves the process.
