/**
 * #1114 follow-up (adversarial review of PR #1130) — the `initialize()`-timeout
 * catch block in `createLSPClient` (clients/lsp/client.ts) has a 2s SIGKILL
 * backstop that was completely untested. Pre-fix it read
 * `if (!lspProcess.process.killed && ...)`: `killProcessTree` called just above
 * it only ever signals the POSIX process GROUP via the raw
 * `process.kill(-pid, …)` syscall (never the `ChildProcess#kill()` method), so
 * `lspProcess.process.killed` never flips true — the guard was always-true and
 * the backstop unconditionally re-sent `SIGKILL` to the (by then already-dead)
 * process handle 2 seconds later, regardless of whether it had already exited.
 * `ChildProcess#kill()` on an already-exited handle is a harmless no-op (it
 * doesn't throw), so this never crashed anything — but it IS the same
 * always-true-guard defect shape as the safe-spawn escalation bug, just with a
 * harmless rather than a silent-failure consequence.
 *
 * This test uses a REAL child process (the fake LSP server fixture, same
 * pattern as teardown-logging.test.ts) with `FAKE_LSP_IGNORE_INITIALIZE=1` so
 * the handshake never completes and `initializeTimeoutMs` fires quickly. The
 * fixture does not ignore SIGTERM, so `killProcessTree`'s real SIGTERM
 * (routed through the process GROUP, since `launchLSP` detaches the child on
 * POSIX) terminates it well within both killProcessTree's own 1.5s escalation
 * window and this backstop's 2s window — giving a real, observable
 * "already exited by the time the backstop fires" case. Post-fix (gate on
 * `exitCode`/`signalCode` both being null — the P3-1 precision fix from the
 * same review round, since a signal-killed process has `exitCode === null`
 * forever and only `signalCode` set), the backstop must NOT call
 * `kill("SIGKILL")` again. Pre-fix, it always did.
 *
 * POSIX-only (killProcessTree's Windows branch is architecturally different —
 * `taskkill /F /T`, not signal-based — and is covered by
 * tests/clients/lsp/kill-process-tree.test.ts instead).
