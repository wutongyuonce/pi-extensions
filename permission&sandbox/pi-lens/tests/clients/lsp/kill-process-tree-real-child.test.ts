// flake-shape: real-process-spawn — a real, live direct child is the ONLY pid whose /proc PPid is this process, so the Linux ownership arm of `isOwnLiveChild` cannot be observed through any double; #3091 round 1 shipped a regression at exactly this site because every case that reached it stubbed the platform away.
/**
 * #2042 / PR #3091 F1 — the Linux ownership arm of `killProcessTree`, against a
 * real child.
 *
 * Round 1 gated `clients/lsp/client.ts#killPosixProcessGroup` on
 * `isOwnLiveChild(pid, site, proc)` and passed the ChildProcess handle. The
 * handle arm ("already reported exit ⇒ refuse") then fired on the
 * `processExiting` path, where `killProcessTree`'s early return at
 * `clients/lsp/client.ts:1269` is deliberately SKIPPED and an already-dead
 * direct child can reach the group kill (the code says so at
 * `clients/lsp/client.ts:1382`). That group SIGTERM is the only thing that
 * reaps surviving grandchildren at host exit (#2026), so the fix turned it off:
 * master signalled `[[-3164880,"SIGTERM"]]`, the round-1 head signalled `[]`.
 *
 * Every other case in this family stubs `process.platform`, so none of them
 * could see it. These do not stub anything: they spawn a real detached child,
 * whose `/proc/<pid>/status` really does carry `PPid: <this process>`.
 *
 * lane: ubuntu Unit tests (`describe.skipIf(process.platform !== "linux")` — the
 * ownership arm reads `/proc`, which only exists there; the Windows arm is
 * covered without a lane by the platform-stubbed case in
 * tests/clients/safe-spawn-kill-ownership.test.ts).
