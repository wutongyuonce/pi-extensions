/**
 * #2130 criterion 2: `memory_sample.subsystems.lsp.clients` must count every
 * live client, including the ones running under a SECONDARY root.
 *
 * The live symptom was a host reporting `clients: 1` while its own
 * `instances.json` entry listed `lspChildCount: 2` with two tsservers alive.
 * The registry set of `activeLspClients` is what the sampler reads, and it was
 * a module-scope `Set`. pi evaluates the pi-lens module graph up to nine times
 * per process (#2146, measured `host_boot` = 9), and each evaluation builds its
 * own `LSPService` and therefore its own fleet — usually one per root, since a
 * secondary root's session binds through a later evaluation. The sampler runs
 * in ONE evaluation, so it counted one evaluation's clients and the other
 * root's servers were invisible.
 *
 * These tests drive the real seam: two evaluations of `client.js`, one live
 * client each, under two different roots, and the snapshot read from the FIRST
 * evaluation.
