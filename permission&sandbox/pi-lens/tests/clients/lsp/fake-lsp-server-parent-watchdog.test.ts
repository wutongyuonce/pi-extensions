/**
 * #2436 regression: `tests/fixtures/fake-lsp-server.mjs` used to have no
 * lifetime bound of its own — only whatever `afterEach`/kill the spawning
 * test happened to register. A vitest worker fork force-killed under load
 * (or by tinypool's own "Timeout terminating forks worker" escape hatch —
 * see vitest.config.ts) never runs that `afterEach`, so the fixture outlived
 * it: a real orphan was found on disk an hour after its parent process no
 * longer existed, holding its worktree directory open (`git worktree
 * remove` → Permission denied / Device or resource busy).
 *
 * Both spawn the fixture via a parent SHIM (`fake-lsp-server-parent-shim.mjs`)
 * that mimics the worst teardown shape the evidence points at: piped stdio,
 * `detached: true` — no OS job/process-group auto-reap at all (the exact
 * shape `launchLSP` uses on POSIX, and the shape a failed Windows
 * job-nesting assignment degrades to) — then SIGKILLs the shim outright: no
 * graceful shutdown, no `afterEach`, nothing JS-level. Both drive the fixture
 * through `FAKE_LSP_WEDGE_STDIN_AFTER_INIT`, which installs a real
 * non-`unref`'d `setInterval` (the same shape
 * service-notify-cpu-liveness.test.ts and shutdown-live-wedged-process.test.ts
 * spawn) so death is provably caused by one of the fixture's own watchdog
 * triggers, not by an idle event loop that would have exited on its own the
 * moment stdin closed regardless of any fix.
 *
 * Two cases, one per trigger in fake-lsp-server.mjs's own comment:
 *
 *   1. Default env — stdin EOF is armed. A paused Readable (which is what
 *      `FAKE_LSP_WEDGE_STDIN_AFTER_INIT` leaves stdin in) still delivers the
 *      underlying `end` event once the fd itself reports EOF, and SIGKILLing
 *      the shim closes its end of the pipe unconditionally (the OS closes a
 *      dead process's fds, pipes included) — so this case reaps via EOF,
 *      fast (well under 100ms observed).
 *   2. `FAKE_LSP_SKIP_EOF_EXIT=1` additionally set on the fixture's own env —
 *      disables the EOF trigger entirely, isolating the `process.ppid`
 *      liveness poll as the ONLY thing that can end the fixture. This is the
 *      trigger that exists for the shape stdin EOF cannot cover on its own:
 *      a pipe write-end held open by something other than the fixture's
 *      direct parent (e.g. Windows handle-inheritance capture by a
 *      long-lived process — see clients/lsp/client.ts:1278-1286). Reaping
 *      here can only be the poll, at up to PARENT_WATCHDOG_INTERVAL_MS
 *      (1000ms) plus scheduling overhead — observed 713-936ms end to end.
