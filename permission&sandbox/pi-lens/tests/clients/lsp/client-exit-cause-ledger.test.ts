/**
 * #1969: an LSP child that closes unprompted leaves a CAUSE record.
 *
 * Live evidence (2026-08-21): an ast-grep child closed with `code=1` and empty
 * stderr, 14 times in one day. Downstream the session showed 19
 * `lsp_client_skipped_broken` cooldowns and 32 `lsp-scanner-coverage-gap`
 * records — all fallout, no cause. The degradation ledger is what a session
 * health read consults, and it held nothing about the death itself.
 *
 * The fix records `lsp-server-unexpected-close` on the child's `close` event,
 * keyed by `serverId`, carrying the exit code, the signal, and whether stderr
 * carried anything. `close` rather than `exit`, so "stderr was empty" is a
 * statement about the server and not a race with the pipe.
 *
 * Two halves, and the second is the mutation guard: an intentional
 * `shutdown()` must record NOTHING. Deleting the `state.shutdownRequested`
 * gate turns every eviction into a fake crash, and reds the second test.

/**
 * Resolve once the child has emitted `close` AND the listeners registered

 *
 * This is the anti-vacuity signal for every "records NOTHING" test here. The
 * handler under test hangs off `close`, so waiting on anything earlier proves
 * nothing: `exit` fires BEFORE `close`, so a wait on `exitCode`/`signalCode`
 * can return while the handler has not run yet, and the assertion that follows
 * passes for the wrong reason. That is exactly how the first version of the
 * initialize-timeout test went green against unfixed code.
 *
 * Attach BEFORE triggering the teardown: a `once` listener added after the
 * event has already fired never resolves. Node dispatches listeners in
 * registration order, and production's handler is installed during
 * `createLSPClient`, so by the time this one runs the ledger write has either
 * happened or been correctly skipped. The extra macrotask hop covers handlers
 * that defer their own work.
