/**
 * Nightly LSP handshake coverage drift guard (#274/#278 follow-through).
 *
 * `scripts/smoke-tools.mjs --lsp` installs, spawns, and verifies the JSON-RPC
 * initialize handshake for each server in `LSP_FIXTURES`. That list is
 * hand-maintained, and the runner-level `smoke-fixture-coverage` guard blanket-
 * exempts the single `lsp` runner — so a newly REGISTERED server gets ZERO
 * nightly handshake coverage and nothing complains. That gap left markdown's
 * marksman (#274) untested until caught by hand, and would have silently left
 * PowerShell's PSES (#278) untested too.
 *
 * This guard closes it structurally: every non-auxiliary server must route to a
 * `LSP_FIXTURES` entry (or be an explicitly-exempt alternate), and every
 * auxiliary server must be exercised via a fixture's `auxiliaryServerIds`. A new
 * server now forces a decision — add a fixture, or exempt it with a reason.
