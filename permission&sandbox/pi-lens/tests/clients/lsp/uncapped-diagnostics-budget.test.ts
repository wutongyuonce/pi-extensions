/**
 * #3402 r2 — what an UNCAPPED `lsp_diagnostics` call pays on a server that
 * publishes nothing.
 *
 * `tools/lsp-diagnostics.ts` leaves `waitMs` undefined unless the caller asks
 * for one, and passes it straight through as `maxClientWaitMs`. `touchFile`'s
 * `perServerTimeout` treats that cap as a CEILING and, with no cap at all,
 * hands the server its full declared `aggregateWaitMs`. So a strategy budget
 * chosen to fit the tool-smoke gate's 8000ms ceiling is not a harness number:
 * it is the wall-clock a normal turn-end diagnostic query blocks for whenever
 * the server has nothing to publish. Round 2 of this PR raised four servers to
 * 8000 for the gate's benefit; this file is the probe that makes that cost
 * visible in a test instead of in a user's turn.
 *
 * The double is production-faithful on the axis under test: it resolves
 * `waitForDiagnostics` only when the budget it was GIVEN elapses, and publishes
 * nothing — the no-publication path. The assertions read the budget it was
 * handed AND the fake-clock time the touch actually blocked, so a fix that
 * merely renamed the number could not pass.
