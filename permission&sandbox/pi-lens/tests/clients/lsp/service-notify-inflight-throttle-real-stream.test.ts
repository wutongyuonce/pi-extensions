/**
 * #1714 (refs #1660) — the same throttle, proven against a REAL server process
 * over real stdio rather than a hand-rolled client double.
 *
 * `LSPService` spawns `tests/fixtures/fake-lsp-server.mjs` and talks to it
 * through the production client: real JSON-RPC framing, real pipes, real
 * ordering. The fixture runs its `FAKE_LSP_NOTIFY_BACKLOG_WEDGE` profile, so the
 * SERVER decides when it has been handed more documents than it can hold and
 * dies the way ast-grep died on live dogfood — stops reading stdin, answers
 * nothing, never recovers.
 *
 * SCOPE, stated because it matters: this harness proves the barrier's PROTOCOL —
 * that the drain round-trip really orders behind the document notifies on a real
 * pipe, and that a healthy server pays no coverage for it. It does NOT reach the
 * wedge, because `touchFile` here waits for the auxiliary's publication on every
 * file and so paces itself to the server. Production's sweep abandons that wait
 * at its budget and moves on, which is the asymmetry that builds the backlog;
 * that half is proven in `service-notify-inflight-throttle.test.ts`, whose double
 * models the sweep's real timing.
