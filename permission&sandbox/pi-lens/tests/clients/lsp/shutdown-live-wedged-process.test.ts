/**
 * #1620 residual — clientShutdown against a REAL wedged child process.
 *
 * `shutdown-wedged-connection.test.ts` proves the bound with a connection
 * double whose sends never settle. That is the right tool for asserting the
 * exact log fields, but it sidesteps the actual mechanism: a real OS pipe
 * only stops accepting writes once its buffer is exhausted, so a genuine
 * "stdin not draining" server needs enough unread traffic ahead of the
 * write, not just an unresponsive peer. This file closes that gap with the
 * real `tests/fixtures/fake-lsp-server.mjs` child process.
 *
 * The fixture's `FAKE_LSP_WEDGE_STDIN_AFTER_INIT=1` mode pauses its stdin
 * for good right after the `initialized` handshake notification. The test
 * then fires three ~4MB (~12MB total) padding `didOpen` writes (unawaited —
 * those writes never settle either) to exhaust the OS pipe buffer, confirmed
 * against a throwaway probe: a single small write past ~1-2MB of unread
 * backlog stops invoking its callback entirely. Only then does
 * clientShutdown's own "shutdown" request and "exit" notification writes
 * race the same wedge.
 *
 * Red-first: reverting #1624's try/finally (restoring the bare unbounded
 * `await safeSendNotification(connection, "exit", {})`) makes this hang to
 * the per-test timeout. See the PR body for the captured red run.
