/**
 * #3389 — a client that disconnects mid-reply must not kill the pi host.
 *
 * ## The recurrence this guards
 *
 * `clients/warm-attach.ts`'s warm diagnostics server accepted connections with
 * a `data` handler and nothing else. `server.on("error")` covers the LISTENER,
 * not the accepted sockets, and a `net.Socket` with no `error` listener
 * rethrows — so a client that destroys its socket while the incumbent is
 * answering (the ending EVERY `requestWarmDiagnostics` timeout, schema refusal
 * and validation refusal takes) raised `Error: read ECONNRESET` as an UNCAUGHT
 * exception in the host. Measured pre-fix through this exact path in a child
 * host: exit code 17 from the probe's `uncaughtException` handler.
 *
 * ## Why a real socket
 *
 * The defect IS a Node stream event on an accepted unix socket / named pipe:
 * no in-process double emits it, and a double that did would be pinning this
 * test's own fixture rather than the host boundary. So the server is the
 * production one (`configureWarmAttach`) and the client is a real
 * `net.createConnection`. No child process and no clock: the wait is a bounded
 * `setImmediate` pump, so none of `flake-shape-ratchet`'s four detectors
 * (real-process-spawn, elapsed-time-assertion, raw-timer-wait,
 * ungoverned-wait-for) apply.
