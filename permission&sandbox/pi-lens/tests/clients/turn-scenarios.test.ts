/**
 * The turn-simulation harness's seed scenarios — #1635 item 1.
 *
 * Four dogfood incidents from 2026-08-18, each replayed as a scripted turn
 * sequence against `handleTurnEnd`, asserting what the AGENT SEES.
 *
 * ## Why some of these are skipped
 *
 * A scenario asserts the CORRECT behavior, always. When the fix for that
 * incident is not on master yet, the scenario carries `pendingOn` and is
 * skipped. It is never rewritten to assert the buggy behavior — a suite that
 * encodes today's bug as today's expectation defends the bug, and the fix then
 * arrives looking like a regression.
 *
 * That also makes the redness proof trivial and honest for the pending ones:
 * delete the `pendingOn` line, run the file, and the scenario fails on current
 * master because the defect is still there. See the PR body for the captured
 * output of each.
 *
 * `skipWhen` is a different thing and says so: the fix exists and the scenario
 * runs, but this host does not have the tool it drives (scenario 2 shells out
 * to a real knip).
 *
 * Live as of this revision: scenario 1 (#1627 merged) and scenario 2 (#1637
 * merged 2026-08-18). Pending: scenario 3 on PR #1633, still open, and
 * scenario 4 on nothing — that blind spot has no fix in flight.

/**
 * knip is a real binary this scenario shells out to, through the REAL
 * `KnipClient`. Review round R1 (S4) was right that the first cut could never
 * fail the way #1630 fails: it replaced the whole client with a stub, and
 * #1637's fix — pruning knip's glob cache before each run — lives inside
 * `KnipClient.analyze`, the layer the stub removed.
 *
 * The availability probe mirrors `tests/clients/knip-cache-consumer-staleness.ts`'s:
 * the suite redirects `PI_LENS_HOME` to a per-worker temp dir, so the managed
 * install has to be found through the real home directory and put on PATH.

/**
 * Probe the BINARY, not the directory that usually holds it.
 *
 * The managed-tools directory can exist while knip itself is absent — a host
 * that installed some other managed tool, or a first run that has not lazily
 * installed knip yet. A directory-existence check calls that "available", the
 * scenario then runs against a client whose `analyze` returns an availability
 * failure with no findings, and the baseline assertion fails for a reason that
 * has nothing to do with the defect. Spawning `knip --version` with the same
 * PATH the scenario will use answers the question that actually matters.
