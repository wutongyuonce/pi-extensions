/**
 * #2939 M7 — `signal: deps.ctx.signal` on the `tool_call` complexity-baseline
 * bootstrap demand.
 *
 * Recurrence prevented: #2523 AC4. The ambient abort slot is published by
 * `tool_result`, AFTER this hook has already run, so at `tool_call` the hook's
 * own `ctx.signal` is the only live signal there is. Without it forwarded, a
 * user who presses Escape while the analyzer graph is still loading waits the
 * demand's whole `BOOTSTRAP_LOAD_TIMEOUT_MS` out before the tool call returns —
 * and the cancel then reaches the ledger as a `timeout`, which is exactly the
 * inversion `requestBootstrapClients`'s `unavailableReason !== "aborted"` guard
 * exists to prevent.
 *
 * PR #3411 round 1 DELETED this forwarding because the file's existing 26 cases
 * stayed green under the deletion: none of them drives the hook with an aborted
 * `ctx.signal` and a load still in flight. This case does, and reds.
 *
 * The bootstrap module is the shared production-faithful `bootstrapSeamMock`,
 * whose `requestBootstrapClients` consumes the caller's signal the way
 * production's `bounded()` does; its load is given a real (faked) delay so
 * "released by the signal" and "waited the load out" are two different
 * observable moments rather than one hang. Everything else — the runtime
 * coordinator, the cache manager, the baseline map — is real.
