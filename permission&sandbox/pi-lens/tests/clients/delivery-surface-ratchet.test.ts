/**
 * #2028/#2029 — delivery-surface adoption ratchet.
 *
 * DELIVERY_SURFACES is the single registry for agent-facing findings/
 * blockers/advisories. `assertNoDeliveryBypass` validates entries IN it,
 * but an emitter that never registers bypasses every gate silently.
 *
 * This ratchet closes that gap: scan clients/ for agent-facing advisory
 * marker emoji (🔴/🛑/🟡) in string/template construction, then require
 * every hit file to appear as a sourceFile in DELIVERY_SURFACES or carry
 * an EXEMPT entry with a reason.
 *
 * Known limitation (documented, accepted floor): the needle matches the
 * emoji CHARACTER in source text; a surface that renders findings without
 * these markers (e.g. plain-text "WARNING:" prefix) is invisible here.
 * The AGENTS.md inventory paragraph is the complementary human check.
