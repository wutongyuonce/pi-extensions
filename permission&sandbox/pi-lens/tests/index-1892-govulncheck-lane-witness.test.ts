/**
 * #1892 witness (ADR 0007) — the GOVULNCHECK LANE through the pi HOST entry.
 *
 * The lane extraction (`clients/turn-end/lanes/govulncheck.ts`) moved every Go
 * CVE freshness, disposition and rendering rule out of
 * `clients/runtime-turn.ts` with no agent-facing change, so the evidence that
 * matters is a committed artifact of what the agent actually receives. This
 * drives `index.ts`'s real registered `session_start` / `turn_start` /
 * `tool_result` / `turn_end` / `context` handlers and diffs the rendered
 * context message against
 * `tests/fixtures/witness/turn-end-lane-govulncheck/advisory-tier.txt`.
 *
 * It covers, in ONE turn, every rule the lane owns:
 *   - a live CVE with its cached call site as `file:line` and its upgrade
 *     target;
 *   - a live CVE with no `fixedVersion` — "no fix yet, track upstream";
 *   - a CVE whose trace carries no filename at all, rendered by its module
 *     (the gate leaves an uncited finding live, so the row must still print);
 *   - a CVE whose call-site file was EDITED after the scan: kept, line
 *     withheld, `[stale — re-run to confirm]` (#1622 sibling sweep);
 *   - a CVE whose call-site file was DELETED after the scan: kept and demoted,
 *     never dropped — `onMissing: "demote"`, because a Go CVE is pinned by
 *     go.mod and not by the call site (#1622 review H1);
 *   - a CVE marked false-positive: gone from the tier, present in the one
 *     suppressed-by-disposition notice as `govulncheck 1` (#1616/#1694 F1);
 *   - the display cap of five, with the `… and 1 more` remainder.
 *
 * The advisory tier itself is the thing the interface amendment added
 * (`TurnEndLaneParts.advisoryParts`), so this golden is also the proof that
 * the composer's tagged push carries a lane's advisory sections to the agent.
 *
 * The only doubles are process boundaries: `clients/pipeline.js` (it spawns
 * every configured linter) and the scanner RESULT cache, written through the
 * REAL `CacheManager` into the project's real cache directory — exactly what a
 * session_start scan leaves behind. The cache manager, the coordinator, the
 * freshness gate, the disposition store, the lane and the context injection are
 * all real.
