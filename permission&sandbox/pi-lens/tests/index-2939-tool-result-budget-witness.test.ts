/**
 * #2939 M8 and W4's call-site half — `index.ts` picks the `tool_result` wall
 * budget and the ledger hook from `isEditClassToolResult(...)` at TWO sites
 * (the inner `bounded(handleToolResult(...))` and the registration wrapper's
 * `budgetKey` callback), and PR #2897's verify measured BOTH green under
 * mutation because every existing test drives `handleToolResult` directly and
 * none drives the registered host handler.
 *
 * Recurrence prevented: #2897 round 1 shipped one 10 s budget for every tool
 * result, so a wedged dependency on a Read held the host twenty times longer
 * than the read-only contract allows (#2523 AC5 — "Read/Grep/Glob/Bash must
 * never await analyzer bootstrap"), and #2939 W4's F3 found the two edit-class
 * copies disagreeing with each other. Both bounds are observed here through
 * the production `hook-await-exceeded` ledger row, whose subject is
 * `<hook>:<label>` and whose reason names the budget that fired.
 *
 * Doubles: the host (`createPiMock`), the analyzer-bootstrap module (the
 * shared production-faithful `bootstrapSeamMock`, because the edit path AWAITS
 * a load that really spawns availability probes), and the TIMING of
 * `handleToolResult` — the real export, wrapped so its promise never settles,
 * which is the wedged dependency these budgets exist for. `bounded` and the
 * degradation ledger are real.
