/**
 * #3310: an asynchronously-indexing push server publishes an EMPTY diagnostic
 * set on `didOpen` (before its whole-workspace index is warm) and the real set
 * once indexing ends. pi-lens's publish handler used to resolve the push wait
 * on the FIRST publish whatever it contained, so `lsp_diagnostics` reported a
 * file with an error as CLEAN — the false clean the wait policy exists to
 * prevent ("a timeout is *not* a false clean", docs/lsp-capability-matrix.md).
 *
 * These cases drive the REAL `lsp_diagnostics` handler, the real LSPService and
 * the real `PHPServer` registry entry — the server that carries the measured
 * `emptyFirstPublish: "indexing"` marker — over a real stdio JSON-RPC wire. The
 * fake server is launched THROUGH that production entry by putting an
 * executable `node_modules/.bin/intelephense` shim in each workspace, which is
 * the first candidate `nodeBinCandidates` resolves (clients/lsp/server.ts), so
 * the strategy lookup under test is the production one, keyed by the real
 * server id, not a hand-set flag.
 *
 * Each case gets its own workspace (hence its own client and its own one-shot
 * hold latch) and its own shim, which sets the wire sequence in its own
 * environment before importing the fixture — so four publish shapes are
 * exercised in one file without a process-wide knob.

// PI_LENS_HOME is deliberately NOT repointed here. `tests/support/vitest-setup.ts`
// already pins a per-worker home and heartbeats an owner marker inside it, so a
// module-scope override both sends the LSP service's logs into a directory this
// file then deletes AND makes the worker read as dead to the hygiene sweep
// ("live owners: none") — the second half of that same leak.
