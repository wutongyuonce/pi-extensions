/**
 * Exhaustive #2434-fold regression coverage for `runDirectoryDiagnostics`'s
 * scan-language decision (tools/lsp-diagnostics.ts).
 *
 * #2458 fix-round F1 (BLOCKER): `SCAN_LANGUAGE_PRIORITY` used to be a FLAT
 * `LanguageId[]` and `runDirectoryDiagnostics` walked it one id at a time,
 * breaking at the first id with any file match. That silently lost the
 * sibling half of every registry-split pair the fold introduced — `.ts`+
 * `.tsx`, `.js`+`.jsx`, `.css`+`.scss`, `.css`+`.less`, `.less`+`.scss`,
 * `.json`+`.jsonc`, `.mts`/`.cts`+`.tsx`, `.mjs`/`.cjs`+`.jsx` — because the
 * pre-#2434 `LANG_EXTENSIONS` table bundled each of those under ONE key and
 * scanned both extensions together, while the per-id loop tried the ids
 * making up that old key separately and stopped at the first match.
 *
 * The fix groups `SCAN_LANGUAGE_PRIORITY` into FAMILIES (one per old golden
 * key) and unions every member id's extensions into ONE `collectFiles`/
 * `hasMatch` call per family. `resolveDirectoryScanExtensions` (exported from
 * tools/lsp-diagnostics.ts) is the exact decision function
 * `runDirectoryDiagnostics` calls in production; this file drives it with an
 * in-memory `hasMatch` predicate instead of real file I/O so every 1- and
 * 2-extension combination in the pre-fold golden extension universe (56
 * extensions -> 1596 combinations) runs in milliseconds, not by spinning up
 * 1596 real directories through the full LSP-mocked tool.
