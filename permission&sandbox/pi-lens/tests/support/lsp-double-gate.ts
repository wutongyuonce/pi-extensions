/**
 * Structural detector for hand-rolled `LSPService` doubles — #2582 round 2.
 *
 * The first cut of this gate was the literal string `touchFile: vi.fn(`. A
 * review broke it five ways in one sitting, and every break is a real shape
 * that lives in `tests/` today:
 *
 *   (a) SHORTHAND — `const touchFile = vi.fn(); ... { supportsLSP, touchFile,
 *       openFile }` (live at `tests/tools/lsp-diagnostics-per-server-
 *       concurrency.test.ts` and `tests/clients/runtime-session-warm.test.ts`);
 *   (b) a NON-`vi.fn` stub — `touchFile: async () => ({ diags: [] })`;
 *   (c) POST-HOC patching — `const service = {}; service.touchFile = vi.fn()`,
 *       where the literal itself carries nothing to match;
 *   (d) MULTILINE — `touchFile: vi` + newline + `.fn()`, which a
 *       whitespace-free regex cannot see at all;
 *
 * and one attack on the sweep rather than on the code:
 *
 *   (e) IDENTIFIER LAUNDERING — `const makeTouchFileMock = vi.fn;` plus
 *       `touchFile: makeTouchFileMock()`, which renames the literal out of the
 *       regex's reach while changing nothing at runtime. `sweep-kit.ts` names
 *       this attack family; round 1 of this sweep shipped 28 of them in
 *       `cascade-compute.test.ts` purely to stay green.
 *
 * So this is an AST analysis, not a text scan, and it asks a SEMANTIC
 * question (#2549): what object does this file hand to a `getLSPService`
 * stub, and was that object SEEDED from `makeLspServiceDouble`? None of
 * (a)-(e) changes the answer, because none of them changes the shape or the
 * seam.
 *
 * ## Anchored on the seam, not on the vocabulary
 *
 * An earlier cut flagged any object literal carrying two `LSPService` method
 * names. It found 159 objects in 65 files — but most were fake LSP *clients*
 * in `tests/clients/lsp/*`, built by `createLSPClient` mocks, which share
 * `getDiagnostics`/`openFile`/`documentSymbol` with the service and are a
 * DIFFERENT seam with its own factory story. Matching a name vocabulary alone
 * cannot tell those apart. So the walk starts at the `getLSPService` stub —
 * `vi.mocked(getLSPService).mockReturnValue(x)`, `mocks.getLSPService
 * .mockReturnValue(x)`, `getLSPService: () => x`, `getLSPService: vi.fn(() =>
 * x)` — and resolves `x` back to the object literal it names, through
 * `as`-casts, local `const`s, local factory functions, `vi.fn()` wrappers and
 * one hop of `holder.current` indirection.
 *
 * ## Two rules, and only ONE of them reads the vocabulary
 *
 * Round 2 of this gate said "the vocabulary is a filter on the resolved
 * object". That was FALSE: the object rule computed `vocabulary ∩ keys`,
 * stored it on the result, and never gated on it, so emptying the vocabulary
 * left the entire population scan green while only the post-hoc fixture went
 * red. The dead plumbing is gone and the two rules are now stated as they
 * actually are:
 *
 *   * **The object rule is SEAM-ONLY, by design.** Any object handed to a
 *     `getLSPService` stub that was not seeded from `makeLspServiceDouble()`
 *     is hand-rolled, whatever keys it carries — that IS the recurrence. A
 *     `getLSPService: () => ({})` is as much a partial double as one naming
 *     twelve methods; it is only harder to notice. So this rule does not
 *     consult {@link lspServiceMethodNames} at all, and a test pins that it
 *     does not.
 *   * **The post-hoc rule is VOCABULARY-GATED, and there the gate is
 *     load-bearing.** For `service.touchFile = …` the property name is the
 *     only signal available: without the vocabulary the rule would flag every
 *     member assignment on every binding the seam receives. Emptying the
 *     vocabulary reds exactly this rule's fixture and nothing else.
 *
 * {@link lspServiceMethodNames} is `Object.keys(makeLspServiceDouble())` — the
 * factory's own default surface, derived rather than hand-copied, so a method
 * added to the factory widens the post-hoc rule in the same commit. It is
 * passed in rather than read from module scope so both properties above are
 * testable through a real seam instead of a mock.
 *
 * ## What it deliberately PERMITS
 *
 * A focused override on a factory-seeded object (`makeLspServiceDouble({
 * touchFile: vi.fn() })`, or a spread of one) is the factory's documented
 * usage and is NOT a violation. A detector that forbade it would push authors
 * straight back to hand-rolling — which is how round 1 ended up laundering
 * identifiers to keep its own sweep green.
 *
 * ## Boundary map — what it cannot see
 *
 * Every entry here is a false NEGATIVE, the safe direction for a ratchet whose
 * job is to stop a known population from growing. Named so a later reader
 * treats this as a ratchet and never as a proof:
 *
 *   * `Object.assign(base, { touchFile })` handed to the seam — the resolver
 *     follows `vi.fn(...)` wrappers and local factory functions, but not an
 *     arbitrary builtin call, so the resulting object is invisible;
 *   * a CLASS INSTANCE (`getLSPService: () => new FakeLspService()`) — a
 *     `new_expression` resolves to no object literal, and the class body's
 *     methods are never walked;
 *   * a double assembled by a helper in ANOTHER module (the shape-c fixture
 *     leans on exactly this, so the post-hoc rule has something only it can
 *     catch);
 *   * indirection deeper than {@link MAX_RESOLUTION_DEPTH} hops, and any
 *     method installed through a computed key.
