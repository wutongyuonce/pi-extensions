/**
 * #3179 — the one real, cross-process reproduction of the crash: no
 * stand-in for `fs.watch`, no stand-in for the removal.
 *
 * PR #3178 (run 35154740539) died with an unhandled 'error' event
 * (`ENOENT: no such file or directory, scandir
 * '.../tests/support/.index-2992-scratch'`) when node's non-native
 * recursive watch (the JS polyfill used on Linux, where inotify has no
 * recursive primitive — lib/internal/fs/recursive_watch.js) re-scanned that
 * directory with a synchronous `readdirSync` exactly as
 * `tests/index-2992-integration.test.ts` removed it between a change event
 * and the rescan.
 *
 * The race is inherently CROSS-PROCESS: `readdirSync`/`statSync` inside
 * node's polyfill are blocking syscalls on ONE thread, so this test's own
 * process can never interleave a removal between them (measured: a tight
 * same-process create/remove loop ran 500k+ iterations across 20s without
 * ever tripping it). A genuinely separate process has to own the other side
 * — the same shape production hits, where the guard's `fs.watch` lives in
 * vitest's main globalSetup process while the producer runs in a worker
 * fork.
 *
 * `tests/support/tests-tree-write-guard.test.ts` carries the deterministic
 * fake-watcher coverage for the swallow-vs-record-once LOGIC in the
 * installed 'error' handler; this file is the one case that drives node's
 * actual internal race end-to-end. Kept in its own file because
 * `admissionHeader` (`tests/support/flake-shape-scan.ts`) only ever reads a
 * file's FIRST `// flake-shape:` header — a second header for a different
 * detector in the sibling file would silently misvalidate its existing
 * raw-timer-wait admission.
 */
// flake-shape: real-process-spawn — the race is cross-process by construction (readdirSync/statSync inside node's recursive-watch polyfill are blocking syscalls on one thread); only a separately spawned process removing the watched directory can land inside that window.
