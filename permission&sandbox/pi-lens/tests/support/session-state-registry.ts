/**
 * Session-state lifecycle registry — #1635 item 2.
 *
 * Eight bugs in the #1266–#1625 arc are one defect: state whose contract is
 * "durable for a SESSION" living in a process-lifetime container, with a reset
 * function that either nobody calls at `session_start` or that no test proves
 * re-arms anything. `#1266` (install-failure suppression), `#1490`/`#1540`
 * (PSScriptAnalyzer latches), `#1497` (install-retry ceiling), `#1535` (zizmor
 * token), `#1537` (lazy-install hold), `#1570` (classic-TS repair guard),
 * `#1618` (workspace sweep hold), `#1625` (deferred dispositions) — each was
 * found in production, one at a time, by a human noticing a tool stayed off.
 *
 * This registry makes that class checkable instead of noticeable. Every entry
 * declares:
 *
 * - WHERE the state lives (module + symbol), so a reader can go look;
 * - WHAT its reset policy is (`session_start`, `turn_end`, `process_lifetime`);
 * - WHICH exported reset implements that policy;
 * - and optionally a PROBE — arm the state, then prove the reset disarms it.
 *
 * `tests/clients/session-state-conformance.test.ts` then checks three things
 * the registry alone cannot assert:
 *
 * 1. every `session_start` entry's reset is genuinely reachable from
 *    `handleSessionStart` (DERIVED by `sessionStartResetNames()`, never a
 *    hand-copied list — that derivation is the whole point);
 * 2. every declared GAP is still a real gap, so a fix landing upstream turns
 *    the stale declaration red instead of leaving a lie in the file;
 * 3. every file the sweep flags as session-state-shaped is either registered
 *    or exempted with a reason.
