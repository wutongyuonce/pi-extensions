 *
 * `bounded()`'s `signal` is a REQUIRED property typed `AbortSignal |

 * compile), but several real seams hold an optional signal and pass it
 * straight through, which leaves them on ONE live bound whenever the caller
 * genuinely had none. That is weaker than #2523's contract, so it is not
 * forbidden — it is ENUMERATED, and the enumeration is what this detector
 * feeds.
 *
 * Round 1 of this PR enumerated the same fact by counting a `NEVER_ABORTED`
 * sentinel constant instead. The sentinel duplicated behaviour `bounded()`
 * already had (it treats a missing signal as one that never aborts), so it was
 * a second concept on an issue whose entire premise is that one primitive
 * replaces the private copies — the reviewer's net-count finding. Deleting it
 * loses nothing here: the registry keys on the CALL, not on a spelling a
 * caller has to remember to use, so it also covers the sites that never named
 * the sentinel.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT a heuristic over the argument's TEXT. "Is this expression
 * possibly `undefined`" is a type question; a regex for `??` / `||` /
 * `undefined` would call `signal: options.signal` — the bootstrap seam, whose
 * parameter is optional and which is the single most important site here —
 * clean, which is the false-negative direction a guard must never take. Every
 * call is registered instead, and its entry states where its signal comes
 * from.
