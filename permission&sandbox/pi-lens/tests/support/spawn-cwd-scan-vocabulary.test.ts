/**
 * One-vocabulary parity for `spawn-cwd-scan.ts` (#2927, folding #2926).
 *
 * `SPAWN_NAMES` and `NODE_SPAWN_NAMES` are the single source of truth for
 * "what counts as a spawn". The scan's own site rule and the sweep's
 * population predicate (`holdsAScannableSpawn`, same module) both derive from
 * them. Each test below loops over the tuple it pins, so adding a name to a
 * tuple automatically extends the coverage: a name the scanner does not scan,
 * or a predicate that does not admit it, reds here instead of riding in
 * uncounted (the #2902 round-3 probe: one name added, 140 tests green).
 *
 * These assert behaviour through the real seams (`scanSpawnCwd`,
 * `holdsAScannableSpawn`), never the derivation expression itself — a test
 * that rebuilt the alternation would pass alongside a drifted copy instead of
 * catching it.
