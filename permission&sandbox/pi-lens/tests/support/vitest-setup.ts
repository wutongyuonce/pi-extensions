 * vitest terminates a fork with SIGTERM — so two green runs left one, then two,
 * private directories holding real stamps. Cleanup therefore belongs to the
 * #2912 serialized hygiene owner (`tests/config/tmp-fixture-hygiene.test.ts`,
 * groupOrder 6, maxWorkers 1), which runs after every other project has drained:
 * no live worker's delayed callback can recreate a directory it removes, which a
 * per-file `afterAll` could not promise. Scoped to this run's id because a
 * concurrent sibling vitest invocation in the same checkout shares `.probe-home`
 * and owns its own directories — the same reasoning as the `pi-lens-test-home-`
 * admission below.
 *
 * Round 3 F1: a run-id-only sweep means a run only ever cleans ITSELF, so every
 * invocation that excludes the hygiene owner — the targeted-run loop this repo
 * runs all day — left one more directory with a real stamp under the persistent
 * home, for ever. Master overwrote ONE stamp per run; that must not become
 * unbounded growth, and the #2912 owner's own rule below says it: "so admissions
 * cannot become a permanent inode leak". The cleanup axis has four cells and one
 * rule covers them, expressed through the repo's existing stale-scratch seam
 * (`scripts/lib/scratch-dir.mjs`, already imported by
 * `tests/support/real-pi-harness.ts`) rather than a second hand-rolled loop:
 *
 * - this run's directories — `backstopRunPrefix`, `SWEEP_ANY_AGE`: the run is
 *   finishing and no worker of it is alive, so the prefix alone is the rule and
 *   no clock comparison enters it (round 5: `maxAgeMs: 0` means "age >= 0" and
 *   skipped a directory whose mtime landed ahead of the process clock, which
 *   redded CI run 35072411511);
 * - a LIVE sibling invocation's — matches neither arm (different run id, and its
 *   directories were written minutes ago at most), so it keeps its cooldown
 *   stamp and its own owner removes them at the end of ITS run;
 * - an ABANDONED foreign run's (a targeted run without the owner file) and
 *   a KILLED run's (OOM/SIGKILL — seen on this host) — the same age arm
 *   reclaims both, since in neither case will an owner ever run for them.
 *
 * `BACKSTOP_STALE_MS` is deliberately generous. Sweeping a live sibling's
 * directory is the F2 flake class (its next sweep loses its cooldown stamp);
 * reclaiming late only delays recovery. The longest observed whole-`ci.yml`
 * workflow on master is 16 minutes (runs 35057763476, 35050766324), so six hours
 * is ~22x the longest invocation this repo produces.
 *
 * `home` exists so the owner's own guard can drive this rule over a fixture
 * directory. The sweep is destructive and the guard runs inside the LAST
 * worker, so a guard aimed at the live home would perform the cleanup itself
 * and hide whether `cleanupTmpHygiene` still calls this at all — measured:
 * with the call deleted, a guard on the live home held the leftover count at 0.
 * That wiring is pinned by a source scan in the owner's file instead (round 3

// files of the default project: p50 93 MB, p90 389 MB, p99 1405 MB, max
// 2267 MB. The heavy tail is NATIVE memory — tree-sitter wasm grammar compiles
// and @ast-grep/napi arenas — which no V8 flag bounds and no reporter shows.
//
// What this record can and cannot say. It is an `afterAll` hook, so it only
// fires for a file that FINISHED. The file that was mid-run when the OS killed
// the job never reports its own peak. What the last lines before a kill name is
// the completed co-residents -- the memory profile of the phase the run died
// in, not the culprit. That is still far better than the nothing there was
// before, but it is circumstantial evidence, not attribution, and the
// `[mem-watch]` low-water mark is the record that says how close the run
// actually came.
//
// `maxRSS` is kilobytes on every platform: libuv normalizes the Win32 peak
// working set for `uv_getrusage`, so no per-platform scaling is needed.
//
// #3139 (#3137 review): this used to be its own top-level `afterAll`,
// registered FIRST so Vitest's LIFO afterAll order ran it LAST — the reading
// then included every other hook's teardown allocation. That fixed the OLD
// direction (an over-budget file's own throw here used to preempt the #3083
// backstop, tmp-hygiene and kill-guard hooks, which ran AFTER it under the
// old bottom-of-file position) but created the INVERSE: Vitest's
// `callSuiteHook` for `afterAll` under `sequence.hooks: "stack"` (this repo's
// default) has no per-hook try/catch — confirmed directly against the
// installed vitest@5.0.0 source (node_modules/vitest/dist/chunks/

// execution loop, `for (const hook of hooks) callbacks.push(await
