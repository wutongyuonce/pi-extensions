/**
 * #2691 / AGENTS.md defect shape 40 — the scan behind
 * `tests/clients/dispatch/runners/runner-spawn-cwd-sweep.test.ts`.
 *
 * ## What it decides
 *
 * For one runner source: every `safeSpawnAsync`/`safeSpawnSync` call site,
 * plus every call site of a same-file function that ROUTES a spawn's `cwd`,
 * and for each of those whether a `cwd` is actually supplied. A site that
 * does not is a shape-40 defect — the child resolves its project config by
 * walking up from the extension host's `process.cwd()` instead of the
 * dispatch cwd, while the runner's own `hasXConfig(ctx.cwd)` gate says the
 * project config was found.
 *
 * ## Why an AST and not a text scan
 *
 * Rounds 1 and 2 of #2693 hand-rolled this over comment/string-blanked text
 * and shipped a fresh hole each time:
 *
 * - r1 tested `\bcwd\b` against the WHOLE call text, so
 *   `typos.getCommand(ctx.cwd)` in ARGUMENT ONE cleared `spellcheck.ts` —
 *   the sweep never caught 1 of the 6 defects it shipped with.
 * - r2 scoped that to the last top-level `{…}` but still tested RAW text, so
 *   a comment between the braces (`// no cwd here: yamllint resolves config
 *   from the file`) or a string value (`resourceLabel: "yamllint-cwd"`)
 *   satisfied it with #2691's defect fully reintroduced.
 * - r2's wrapper rule — "a `function NAME(…)` whose parameter list has a
 *   `{…}`-shaped parameter naming cwd" — is a syntactic proxy that missed
 *   `helm-lint.ts`'s `lintChart(chartRoot, cwd)` and `helm-render.ts`'s
 *   `renderAndValidate(chartRoot, cwd, filePath)`, both of which take `cwd`
 *   POSITIONALLY and route it straight into a spawn. Replacing `ctx.cwd`
 *   with `process.cwd()` at both callers left the round-2 sweep green.
 *
 * Blanking the slice — the round-2 review's prescribed remedy for the first
 * two — closes the comment and the string and leaves
 * `env: { ...process.env, PWD: cwd }` green: that `cwd` is a real
 * identifier, blanked by nothing, sitting in a property named `env`. No
 * text rule separates it from the options key, because the difference is
 * structural. Every one of these is one mistake in four spellings —
 * AGENTS.md defect shape 34, "a guard that enumerates surface spellings".
 *
 * So the scan asks a parser the three questions that actually decide it:
 *
 * 1. does the options literal have a PROPERTY NAMED `cwd`, and is its value
 *    usable,
 * 2. does that value trace back to `resolveToolCwd` imported from the shared
 *    seam (the #2777 origin rule), and
 * 3. does the `cwd` value inside a spawn resolve to a PARAMETER of an
 *    enclosing named function (which makes that function a spawn-routing
 *    wrapper, and its own callers the sites that must be checked)?
 *
 * `@ast-grep/napi` is already a runtime dependency and already backs a
 * governance sweep in this repo — `tests/support/availability-gate.ts`
 * (#1476), whose header records the same lesson: "the first version of this
 * gate was regexes and a review broke it seven ways in one sitting."
 * (`typescript` is not an option: this repo is on TypeScript 7, whose
 * package exports `version` and nothing else — there is no
 * `ts.createSourceFile` to call.)
 *
 * The full state space — call-site kind × where a `cwd` token can sit, with
 * the expected verdict per cell — is the "Detector state space (round 3)"
 * table on PR #2693, and every cell has a named fixture in
 * `spawn-cwd-scan.test.ts`.
 *
 * ## Freeze policy (#2927)
 *
 * A new scanner finding is a reason to SIMPLIFY this scanner, not to extend
 * it. Every extension so far (rounds 1 through 5, #2888, #2902) closed the
 * shown hole and left the next spelling open — AGENTS.md defect shape 34, "a
 * guard that enumerates surface spellings". If a finding does not converge in
 * one verify round, the fallback is an ast-grep rule matching any
 * `child_process` call not routed through the seam, run by the existing rule
 * engine, with this scanner deleted.
 *
 * Stated bounds: the scanner recognizes only the seven names in
 * `NODE_SPAWN_NAMES` when bound from `child_process`; other child-process API
 * spellings remain outside this scan and stay covered by the population's
 * fail-safe bound assertion.

 * `function w(opts) { safeSpawnAsync(c, a, { cwd: opts.cwd }) }` is NOT
 * treated as a spawn-routing wrapper, so its callers are never checked. That
 * is a real, stated bound, not an oversight — `w(x)` gives the scan an
 * argument that is a whole options object, and nothing syntactic separates a
 * caller that fills in `cwd` from one that does not. The reviewer signal for
 * such a helper is the direct-site count bump its own spawn produces; there is
 * no live instance in `clients/dispatch/runners/` today. To be followed, a
 * wrapper must take the cwd itself — positionally, destructured, or
 * destructured from an options parameter in its body, all three of which the
 * live wrappers use. Every runner in this tree has an `async run(ctx: DispatchContext)`
 * whose spawn's cwd traces back to `ctx`; if `ctx.cwd` counted, `run` itself
 * would be classified a "spawn-routing wrapper taking a cwd at parameter 0"
 * and every in-file `run(ctx)` call would be flagged for not passing a cwd —
 * exactly backwards. A parameter is a routed cwd only when the spawn uses
 * THE PARAMETER as the cwd, which is the reviewer's round-2 separating
 * property stated precisely. A wrapper that instead takes a whole context
 * and reads `.cwd` off it is a stated bound of this scan (state-space
 * table); there is no such wrapper in the tree today, and nothing syntactic
 * distinguishes a caller that passes a good context from one that does not.

/**
 * ## Lexical scope, taken from the grammar instead of from a list of kinds
 *
 * Rounds 1-3 answered "which binding does this `cwd` refer to?" by scanning
 * declarators inside the nearest enclosing FUNCTION (r1), then inside
 * "a function or a `statement_block`" (r2/r3). Each spelling closed the
 * launderer it was shown and left the next scope node open: r3 shipped with a
 * dead `switch` case and a `for` head still able to hand the real yamllint
 * spawn a `ctx.cwd` with the sweep green (review v3 F1). Adding `switch_body`
 * and a `for` head to that list would be the fourth spelling of the same
 * mistake — AGENTS.md defect shape 34, a guard that enumerates surface
 * spellings.
 *
 * So this asks the tree. A `const`/`let` binding's scope is the node that OWNS
 * its declaration statement, whatever the grammar calls it; a `var` binding's
 * scope is the enclosing function, wherever inside it the statement sits. The
 * grammar's own node-type table — `@ast-grep/napi/lang/TypeScript.d.ts`,
 * header "Auto-generated from tree-sitter TypeScript v0.23.2", the
 * `node-types.json` tree-sitter generates — lists exactly fourteen node types
 * that can own a declaration:
 *
 *   ambient_declaration · do_statement · else_clause · export_statement ·
 *   for_in_statement · for_statement · if_statement · labeled_statement ·
 *   program · statement_block · switch_case · switch_default ·
 *   while_statement · with_statement
 *
 * Twelve of them ARE the scope, and need no mention here because
 * {@link scopeOfDeclarator} reads whichever one the parse produced. Two are
 * not, and are the only kinds this file has to name:
 *
 * - `export_statement` and `ambient_declaration` wrap a declaration without
 *   scoping it (`export const cwd = …` is module-scoped, not
 *   export-statement-scoped), so they are transparent; without this, a
 *   module-level `export const cwd = resolveToolCwd(…)` would false-red.
 * - `switch_case` / `switch_default` own the statement syntactically, but JS
 *   scopes a case's declarations to the whole `switch_body`, so the scope
 *   widens by one node.
 *
 * `spawn-cwd-scan.test.ts` regenerates the list of fourteen from that same
 * file and fails unless every kind has a launderer fixture, so a grammar bump
 * that adds a scope-owning node type reds there instead of silently opening
 * the hole this comment describes.
