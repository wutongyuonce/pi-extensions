 * also exports one; and any file exporting a `_reset…ForTests`-style seam.
 * Those pairings are the observed shape of every process-lifetime-latch bug in
 * the #1266–#1625 arc (and #2319's process-singleton twin): state that outlives
 * a session plus a reset nobody calls at the session boundary.
 *
 * MISSES — and each of these is a real, currently-unguarded class:
 * 1. **Scalar state.** `let installRetryGeneration = 0`, a boolean latch, a
 *    `number` cooldown deadline (`lsp/server.ts`'s
 *    `directLspCommandUnavailableUntil`). No container, so no signal.
 * 2. **Closure state.** `createAvailabilityLatch()`'s verdict lives in a
 *    closure, not a module-level container. The registry covers these by hand
 *    because the scan cannot.
 * 3. **State with no reset seam at all.** The scan needs the pairing; state
 *    nobody ever wrote a reset for is invisible to it. This is the worst
 *    blind spot, because "no reset exists" is a stronger version of the bug
 *    the sweep is looking for.
 * 4. **Instance fields.** `private readonly cache = new Map()` on a class the
 *    bootstrap builds once is session-scoped in practice and indented in
 *    source, so column-zero matching skips it.
 * 5. **Semantics.** The scan cannot tell a session-scoped dedupe set from a
 *    frozen lookup table built once at import. That judgment stays in the
 *    registry and in `SessionStateExemption` (the shape formerly exported here)'s reasons.
 *
 * The #1817 symbol-count pin narrows the FIRST four of these from "invisible"
 * to "a total the pin table tracks", but it inherits one more blind spot of
 * its own:
 *
 * 6. **Substitution.** Adding one new uncleared container while removing an
 *    already-covered one leaves the file's total count unchanged, so the pin
 *    sees nothing. The pin proves the COUNT is deliberate, not that every
 *    individual symbol behind it still is — a swap that nets to zero is
 *    invisible to a total the same way it would be to a checksum. Full
 *    symbol-to-reset attribution (#1817's option (a), not taken here) is the
 *    only way to close this; the count pin's job is the cheaper, LOUDER
 *    common case where a symbol is added without one being removed.
 *
 * The sweep is therefore a floor, not a proof of coverage. It makes a NEW
 * matching file impossible to add without a decision; it does not certify
 * that everything session-scoped is registered.
