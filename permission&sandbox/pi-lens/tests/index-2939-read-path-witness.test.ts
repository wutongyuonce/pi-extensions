/**
 * #2939 M11 and W3 — the two `index.ts` `tool_result` guards that only exist
 * for the READ-ONLY path, and that PR #2897's verify measured green under
 * mutation because no test drives the registered host handler with a read.
 *
 * Recurrences prevented:
 *
 * - M11: #2897 round 1's `if (!rtMutation) return;` dropped every read/search
 *   result before `handleToolResult`, so native-read registration stopped and
 *   the next edit to a file the agent HAD read was blocked as `zero_read`
 *   (finding F1, rated CRITICAL). Witnessed through the production
 *   `read_pattern` read-guard row the registration emits.
 * - W3: the behaviour seam's `?? getAgentBehaviorClient()` fallback. Before it,
 *   `resident?.agentBehaviorClient?.recordToolCall(...) ?? []` recorded
 *   NOTHING whenever `peekBootstrapClients()` was null — which is every tool
 *   result before an analyzer bootstrap has completed, i.e. the majority of a
 *   session's results and all of them before the first edit. Witnessed
 *   through the real process-wide `agentBehaviorClient`: two reads driven
 *   through the registration make a third, DIRECT call the one that trips the
 *   thrash threshold, so the count asserted is the handler's contribution and
 *   not this test's.
 *
 * Doubles: the host (`createPiMock`), `handleSessionStart` (reduced to the one
 * thing this file needs from it — pointing the runtime at the temp project,
 * the same reduction `tests/index-observed-sweep-no-read-guard.test.ts` uses),
 * the bootstrap module's shared production-faithful seam with a load that
 * never completes (the state W3's fallback exists for; `peekBootstrapClients`
 * answers null exactly as production does, and `getAgentBehaviorClient`
 * returns the real singleton), and the read-guard log EMIT, which production
 * no-ops under `isTestMode()`. The read guard, the runtime coordinator, the
 * behaviour client and `handleToolResult` are all real.
