/**
 * #3347 — the expiry check on the clean-signal marker class.
 *
 * ## The recurrence each assertion prevents
 *
 * The repaired `probe-clean-signal.mjs` rewrites the matrix's `clean-behavior`
 * column from a measurement (through the nightly `bot/lsp-docs-refresh` auto-PR),
 * while `silentOnClean` in clients/lsp/wait-policy/strategies.ts is
 * hand-maintained. The two sources drift in five distinct ways, and each one is a
 * live wait-policy defect rather than a docs nit:
 *
 *  1. a row measured `silent` with no marker — the cascade burns the whole
 *     in-lane wait it could skip (the pre-#458 situation);
 *  2. a marker on a row measured `publishes-*` — the cascade skips a wait the
 *     server would have resolved with a real publish (#3347's cue case);
 *  3. a marker whose server has NO measured push row at all — nothing can ever
 *     expire it, so it outlives the measurement that justified it (the escape
 *     that shipped in round 2: a marker added to `typos` passed the census);
 *  4. a push row whose cell goes blank or back to `TBD`/`unknown` — the row drops
 *     out of a matrix-driven comparison silently, taking its marker coverage
 *     with it;
 *  5. a row whose `mode` flips to `pull` while keeping a `silent` cell —
 *     `clean-behavior` is a push-wait measurement, so that combination is not
 *     evidence for the marker it still appears to support.
 *
 * So the census walks BOTH populations: every matrix row (1, 2, 4, 5) and every
 * registry entry (3). Deliberately a two-source governance test — it parses the
 * checked-in matrix with the same parser the nightly generator uses and reads the
 * real registry the LSP client imports; it recreates neither.
