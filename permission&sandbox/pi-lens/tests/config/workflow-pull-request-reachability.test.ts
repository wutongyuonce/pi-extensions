// Registered-or-fail sweep: every job-level `if:` in a workflow a pull
// request can trigger must be reachable ON a pull request, or be registered
// here with a reason.
//
// THE RECURRENCE (#3043, and the 2026-09-15 retro's F2). #3033 edited the
// `pnpm-global` and `mise-repro` steps of install-smoke.yml. Both jobs were
// gated `if: github.event_name != 'pull_request'`, so that PR's own CI ran
// ZERO of the lines it changed; six matrix cells then failed on every master
// push for a day before a human read master. #3049 fixed the one instance by
// giving `pi-load` a PR-eligible cell and its own round-2 review named the
// next one: "`mise-repro` has no `pull_request` cell -- so moving its
// `export PATH=` line below the `pnpm config set` line would have reached
// master unseen." Nothing generic stopped the third. This file is that
// generic thing.
//
// WHAT "REACHABLE" MEANS HERE: eligible to EXECUTE on a pull_request event.
// Not "blocking" -- `mise-repro` is deliberately `continue-on-error` and its
// PR cell exists so the edited lines run and land in a log, not to gate the
// merge. A job with no `if:` at all is trivially reachable and is not
// examined.
//
// EVALUATION: the same technique as tests/config/ci-infra-kill-rerun-gate.ts
// and install-smoke-gates.ts -- yaml.load the REAL workflow, substitute every
// context path in the LOADED `if:` string with a JSON literal, and evaluate
// with `new Function`. GitHub Actions expression syntax and JS agree exactly
// on this subset (dotted paths, `==`, `!=`, `&&`, `||`, parentheses, quoted
// strings and numbers). An unrecognised context path THROWS rather than
// being guessed at, so a workflow that grows a new one fails loudly here
// instead of being silently read as reachable.
//
// THE MODEL, and what it cannot see. Reachability is decided against a small
// declared set of pull_request contexts (PR_CONTEXTS below) -- a job is
// reachable if ANY of them makes its `if:` true. `needs.*.result` reads
// `success` and `needs.*.outputs.*` reads `'true'`, the permissive reading:
// a job that is reachable only when an upstream job FAILS will read as
// unreachable and needs a registry entry naming that. Two known blind spots,
// stated rather than papered over:
//   1. A workflow with no `pull_request`/`pull_request_target` trigger at all
//      is out of scope -- the nightly-only lanes (tool-smoke, compat-smoke,
//      parser-smoke, release, labels, ...) are deliberate, and flagging every
//      job in them would bury this sweep's real signal in a registry nobody
//      reads.
//   2. Exclusion moved OUT of `if:` and INTO a matrix expression that
//      narrows to an empty list on pull_request would evade this scan. No
//      workflow does that today; install-smoke's three narrowed jobs all
//      keep a non-empty PR cell, which
//      tests/config/install-smoke-gates.test.ts evaluates cell by cell.
