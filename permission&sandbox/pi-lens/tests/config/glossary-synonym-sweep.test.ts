/**
 * #3259 synonym-retirement sweep.
 *
 * The glossary is the source of truth. This census reads it at test time,
 * blanks comments and strings, and counts only whole TypeScript identifier
 * tokens in the runtime source population. A retired synonym in prose, a
 * string (including template text), or a larger identifier such as
 * `blockerCount` is not a code-vocabulary use. `${...}` remains code because
 * the shared stripper lexes template interpolations as ordinary source.
 *
 * Multi-word retired phrases and hyphenated phrases are deliberately listed
 * below as non-identifiers. They cannot be declaration/member identifiers;
 * any evidence for them is prose or a string literal and is therefore outside
 * this lexical sweep. There are no identifier needles with string-only
 * evidence in this population, so no `codeMatches` exception is needed.
 *
 * The pins are the rename inventory for #3259, held to EXACT equality per
 * `(term, file)`. `auditSymbolCounts` alone cannot do that: `auditRegistry`
 * is deliberately asymmetric, so a REGISTERED `file@count` row the scan no
 * longer flags passes. Round 2 shipped exactly that hole — deleting five live
 * `warning` identifiers from `clients/runtime-turn.ts` left the suite green
 * (#3279 G-3279-4), which is the #3256 M3c stale-pin failure again. Equality
 * is therefore audited as TWO calls with the roles swapped, each carrying its
 * own message, so a rename slice knows which direction it hit:
 *   - `UNPINNED live uses` — live rows the pin does not name (grow).
 *   - `STALE pins` — pinned rows the live census no longer produces (shrink).
 * Both clean means the two `file@count` key sets are equal.
 *
 * Glossary retirement grammar: each declaration is a bullet whose bold term
 * is followed by `retires` plus one or more backtick-delimited synonyms,
 * ending at the declaration's period. A bullet mentioning `retires` that
 * does not match this grammar is malformed and must fail loudly.
 *
 * A spelling can be BOTH canonical for its own concept and retired by another
 * concept (`finding` retires `diagnostic`, while `diagnostic` is canonical at
 * `clients/dispatch/types.ts`). Those `retired-in-one-sense` terms are
 * excluded from the global census — a lexical spelling count cannot tell the
 * two senses apart — so the exclusion itself is pinned as a DERIVED list of
 * `term -> owning module -> retiring concept`, read out of the glossary's own
 * `owned by` clause. Every per-concept rename slice under #3259 works from
 * that list, and a new collision reds it instead of vanishing silently
 * (#3279 G-3279-2).
