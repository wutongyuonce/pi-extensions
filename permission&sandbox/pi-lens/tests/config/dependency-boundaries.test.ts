		// config-warn on the path instead of each loader directly) and one is
		// net-new: config-warn -> degradation-ledger, the warn seam recording its

		// chain, so that edge closes a baseline-class cycle rather than
		// introducing new coupling — the same reasoning entry 30 was accepted
		// under (#2173). Reduction stays tracked in #2125.
		//
		// #2426: 31 -> 33. Two entries RESHAPED (the loaders resolve through the
		// shared `clients/config-resolve.js`, so it sits on the pre-existing
		// config-warn -> degradation-ledger -> extension-log -> file-utils cycle
		// where `project-lens-config.js` sat directly) and two net-new
		// config-warn edges, both the shared resolver reporting through the SAME
		// seam each loader already used. The same PR REMOVED six cycles it would
		// otherwise have added: `resolveConfig` moved out of the `config-core`
		// barrel so a resolver no longer drags `process-spec` -> `project-trust`,
		// and `config-core` lost both of its sink imports
		// (`reportPiLensConfigRecords` -> `config-resolve.js`,
		// `DEGRADATION_ENTRIES_PER_KIND` -> the `ledger-bounds.js` leaf), which is
		// what that module's own doc always claimed of it.
		//
		// #2426 review round 2 adds NO entry: `workspace-topology.js` now imports
		// the shared basename table from `config-locations.js` instead of carrying
		// its own copy, and that module's transitive set
		// (`config-diagnostic-codes.js`, `path-utils.js`) reaches nothing that
		// imports back into the topology index, so the edge closes no cycle.
		//
		// #2516 round 2: 33 -> 12, the largest reduction this ratchet has seen,
		// and ZERO entries added. `getGlobalPiLensLogDir()` and the probe-home
		// redirect moved from `clients/file-utils.js` onto the cycle-free
		// `clients/probe-home-state.js` leaf; `extension-log.js` imported
		// `file-utils.js` for that function and nothing else, so the edge went
		// with it and took the whole `file-utils` -> `safe-spawn` ->
		// `degradation-ledger` -> `extension-log` -> `file-utils` cycle with it.
		// Eighteen other log-family modules dropped the same edge. The two
		// violations CI reported mid-round were the SURVIVING `file-utils` ->
		// `safe-spawn` and `git-tracked-ignore` -> `safe-spawn` edges reporting a
		// different representative path (through `resource-sampler` ->
		// `instance-reaper`) once the shorter one was gone — not new coupling.
		// `file-utils.js` is still on that remaining cycle, which is why the
		// resolver must stay off it. Reduction stays tracked in #2125.
