// #3217 recurrence guard: 43 LSP fixtures were added to
// `scripts/smoke-tools.mjs` between #2780 (which built the nightly clean gate)
// and 2026-09-18 WITHOUT gate coverage — nightly run 35334544752 drove the real
// `lsp_diagnostics` handler for 7 servers out of ~50 while the other ~43 only
// had to complete an `initialize` handshake. That is the exact hole #2776
// (provenance) walked through: it passed the handshake layer and shipped.
// Nothing in the repo noticed, because opting in was a per-fixture flag with no
// counterpart asserting the flag was considered.
//
// This file makes the decision explicit and mandatory: every fixture the gate
// COULD drive carries either `lspGate: true` or an `lspGateExempt: "<reason>"`,
// so a new fixture cannot silently join the handshake-only population.
//
// It reads the fixture table as DATA (`import { LSP_FIXTURES }`) rather than
// scanning `smoke-tools.mjs` as text, so no comment, string literal or
// commented-out block can satisfy any assertion here (#3217 F5 — the
// "detectors match code, not prose" screen, satisfied structurally instead of
// by comment-and-string blanking).
