// Pins install-smoke.yml's job-level `if:` event gates (#2613 review T1).
// Exactly ONE job still carries one: `host-latest-smoke`'s
// `schedule`/`workflow_dispatch` gate, the nightly advisory drift lane.
// `host-range-smoke` deliberately carries NO gate (it is the PR-gating lane)
// and is intentionally absent from this table.
//
// #3043: `pi-load` LEFT this table. It used to carry a
// `!= 'pull_request'` gate, which is why #3033 could edit its pnpm-global
// arm and ship a break no PR-eligible lane could execute -- six matrix cells
// then failed on every master push for a day. Its gating moved into an
// event-dependent matrix (one ubuntu x pnpm-global cell on pull_request, the
// full 2x4 otherwise); the block at the bottom of this file evaluates that
// real expression per event.
//
// 2026-09-15 retro F2: `smoke` and `mise-repro` left this table the same way
// and for the same reason -- #3049's own round-2 review named mise-repro as
// the next member of #3043's class ("moving its `export PATH=` line below
// the `pnpm config set` line would have reached master unseen"). Their
// per-event matrices are evaluated at the bottom of this file beside
// pi-load's, and the general rule they now satisfy is swept over every
// workflow by tests/config/workflow-pull-request-reachability.test.ts.
//
// Same technique as tests/config/ci-infra-kill-rerun-gate.test.ts (#2668
// review F3): load the REAL workflow via yaml.load, then evaluate the
// LOADED `if:` string (never a hand-copied restatement of it) against a
// synthetic `github.event_name` via `new Function` — GitHub Actions
// expression syntax and JS agree exactly on this subset (dotted paths, `==`,
// `!=`, `&&`, `||`, quoted string literals).
//
// Before this file existed, dropping all three `!= 'pull_request'` gates
// AND the schedule gate stayed 27/27 green (no test in the repo evaluated
// any of these `if:` strings) — proven below by deleting one gate.
