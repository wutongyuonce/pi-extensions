/**
 * #2582 — hand-rolled `LSPService` doubles: a semantic sweep, a two-sided
 * ratchet, and a two-part admission gate.
 *
 * The recurrence this guards: a test stubs `getLSPService` with a partial,
 * hand-rolled object, production later calls a method that object does not
 * have, and the failure lands in a swallow-all catch. It has cost three rounds
 * already — #1766 F3 (`isSpawnInFlight`), #2540/#2582 F3
 * (`getAuxiliaryClientsForFile`), and the CI red on this branch's first head
 * (`tests/clients/lsp-lazy-liveness.test.ts:88`). `makeLspServiceDouble` gives
 * every such test the full surface with focused overrides; this sweep keeps
 * the hand-rolled population from growing back.
 *
 * ## The baseline is EMPTY (#2592)
 *
 * #2585 shipped this as a ratchet over 18 surviving hand-rolled doubles in 17
 * files. #2592 migrated all 17 onto the factory, so
 * `tests/support/lsp-double-baseline.json` is now `{}` and the ratchet is a
 * plain gate: with nothing pinned, EVERY live hit is a `new-file` red. The
 * ratchet machinery is kept rather than deleted because it is what makes the
 * gate re-openable — a future double that genuinely cannot use the factory
 * pays the two-part admission below instead of being waved through, and the
 * `vanished-pin` / `dead-admission` rules keep a half-burnt pin from
 * lingering.
 *
 * ## The admission gate, and why it exists
 *
 * Round 2 shipped this ratchet with the defect the ratchet exists to stop, one
 * level up: a brand-new test file carrying a hand-rolled double, plus ONE line
 * added to the baseline JSON, passed the whole suite — no reason, no second
 * gate. That is #2582 round 1's identifier laundering in a new spelling, and
 * it is AGENTS.md defect shape 38: a guard a one-line data edit satisfies
 * away.
 *
 * So a pin costs three edits in three places, and EVERY pin pays: an entry in
 * `tests/support/lsp-double-baseline.json` (the count), an entry in
 * {@link ADMITTED} with a reason naming the issue that tracks it, and a
 * `// lsp-double: <reason>` header in the file itself. One of the three is
 * source-reviewed prose in the admitted file, so a data edit alone admits
 * nothing. Same shape as `tests/clients/flake-shape-ratchet.test.ts`'s
 * admission gate (header + `wallClockBudgetInclude` membership), reused rather
 * than re-derived.
 *
 * Round 3 tried to spare the seventeen inherited files by exempting an
 * `ORIGINAL_POPULATION` Set, and the verifier walked straight through it: a
 * fresh double, one baseline line, one line in the Set, 29/29 green. An exempt
 * tier IS a door. There is one path in and one path out; the seventeen carried
 * their headers like everything else until #2592 removed all three parts per
 * file.
 *
 * ## The rules
 *
 * Live-vs-pin, two-sided: `new-file`, `count-risen`, `stale-ceiling`,
 * `vanished-pin`. Provenance: `unadmitted-pin`, `missing-header`,
 * `reason-not-real`, `dead-admission`. The PR body for #2585 carries the
 * (state × writer) cell list; every cell below has a test.
 *
 * ## Why the detector is structural
 *
 * Round 1 of this sweep was the literal string `touchFile: vi.fn(`, and it
 * shipped with 28 `const makeTouchFileMock = vi.fn;` call sites in
 * `cascade-compute.test.ts` whose only purpose was to rename the literal out
 * of its own reach. `tests/support/lsp-double-gate.ts` replaces it with an AST
 * walk from the `getLSPService` seam; the five shapes that defeated the regex
 * are pinned below as REAL FIXTURE FILES under
 * `tests/fixtures/lsp-double-gate/`, read and parsed through the same path as
 * the population walk — a string concatenated inside this file would only
 * prove the sweep agrees with itself.

 * line, one line added to that Set, and the suite was 29/29 green with no
 * reason and no header. That is #2585 round 2's escape relocated one `Set`
 * away, and it is the Screen clause of AGENTS.md shape 38 failing on the very
 * guard that introduced the shape.
 *
 * So there is ONE path in and one path out, for anything added tomorrow
 * exactly as for the seventeen files inherited from #2582: a pin in
 * `tests/support/lsp-double-baseline.json`, an entry here naming the issue
 * that tracks it, and a `// lsp-double: <reason>` header in the file itself.
 * Burn-down removes all three; the dead-admission rule reds on any leftover.
 * #2592 burnt all seventeen down, which is why this map is now empty — and
 * empty is the state the cell-by-cell tests below exist to keep meaningful.
 *
 * The old tier was also inverted in its own terms: keeping a burned-down file
 * in `ORIGINAL_POPULATION` PERMITTED a silent re-pin rather than preventing
 * one — `lsp/late-auxiliary-findings` was migrated in round 3 and stayed in
 * the Set, so only a separate hardcoded array noticed when it came back.
 * That array is gone too: a migrated file that regrows a double is now a
 * `new-file` red like any other.
