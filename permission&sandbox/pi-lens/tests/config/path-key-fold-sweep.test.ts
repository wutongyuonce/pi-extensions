/**
 * #1193 P3 enforcement: no NEW hand-rolled path transformation outside
 * `clients/path-utils.ts`.
 *
 * `toPosix` exists because the idiom `p.replace(/\\/g, "/")` was hand-copied
 * across the tree, and its own doc comment states the reason a lint rule was
 * impossible before the fold: "today a bare inline `.replace(/\\/g, "/")` is
 * byte-identical to the sanctioned use so it can't be ruled (#1158); once
 * everything routes through `toPosix`, an un-migrated inline `.replace`
 * becomes detectable." This is that detector. Four merged September path-key
 * defects (#3159, #3169, #3178 — four rounds — and #3192) are the recurrence
 * it prevents: every one of them was two spellings of one path deriving two
 * keys, and every new hand-rolled fold is a fresh chance at the same bug.
 *
 * It pins TWO shapes, per file, as a shrink-only census (`auditSymbolCounts`,
 * the same machinery the session-state sweep uses — a file whose count moves
 * in EITHER direction presents an id the pin does not name and fails loud):
 *
 *   A. **Raw separator fold** — a literal `.replace(/\\/g, "/")`. The
 *      sanctioned spelling is `toPosix`.
 *   B. **Path-key case fold** — a `.toLowerCase()` applied to the result of a
 *      `path`/`win32`/`posix` call, or sitting in the same statement as a
 *      `"win32"` platform test. The sanctioned spellings are
 *      `normalizeEphemeralMapKey` (process-local, same-run keys) and
 *      `normalizeMapKey`/`normalizeFilePath` (filesystem-canonical keys).
 *
 * Scanned trees are `clients/`, `tools/`, `mcp/` and `index.ts` — the runtime
 * surface where a path becomes a map key. `scripts/` is deliberately out:
 * its `.mjs` helpers run before `npm run build` in workflows that never
 * install, so they cannot import the compiled seam (the same build-order
 * constraint `tests/config/escape-regexp-fold-sweep.test.ts` documents for
 * `merge-train-lane.mjs`), and none of them derives a map key.
 *
 * Both shapes are matched against CODE ONLY, under
 * `stripSource(..., { strings: "blank" })`: comments, string literals AND
 * template-literal TEXT are blanked, while a template's `${...}` interpolation
 * keeps being lexed as ordinary code (`stripSource` has done that since #2502),
 * so a fold inside an interpolation still counts. Round 1 shipped
 * `strings: "keep"` here and review finding F1 proved the hole with the
 * detector's own export — `countPathCaseFolds("const doc = \`path.resolve(p)
 * .toLowerCase()\`;")` answered **1**, and the separator needle behaved the
 * same way. That is the self-excuse direction AGENTS.md defect shape 38 forbids:
 * a string copy of the needle could make an unregistered fold read as live, or
 * keep a pin looking current after its real fold was deleted.
 *
 * `strings: "keep"` was chosen in round 1 because shape A's needle IS a regex
 * literal (blanking erases the regex body) and shape B's arm 2 keyed on the
 * `"win32"` string. Both evidences are retained WITHOUT it, and each has its
 * own test below:
 *
 * - shape A goes through `codeMatches` (`tests/support/sweep-kit.ts:477`),
 *   which already solves exactly this: it matches the needle on RAW source,
 *   then keeps only the matches whose span is still code in the
 *   strings-blanked text. The regex body is therefore visible to the MATCH and
 *   invisible to the laundering check. No new stripper, and no new option on
 *   `stripSource` — the kit already owned the mechanism.
 * - shape B arm 2 keys on the `platform` IDENTIFIER of the comparison
 *   (`platform ===`, `process.platform !==`) rather than the `"win32"` literal
 *   it is compared against. An identifier survives string blanking, cannot be
 *   written inside a string to launder a site, and is the structural fact
 *   rather than one spelling of it (AGENTS.md defect shape 34).
 *
 * SWEEP_HEURISTIC_LIMITS.
 *
 * 1. Shape B's second arm keys on a `"win32"` literal in the same statement, so
 *    a fold behind an already-hoisted boolean
 *    (`const isWin = process.platform === "win32"; … isWin ? x.toLowerCase() : x`)
 *    is not detected. That is a known blind spot, not a silent one: shape B's
 *    first arm still catches every fold applied DIRECTLY to a path expression,
 *    which is how all five #1193 P3 members were written.
 * 2. `PATH_CALL` requires a `path.`/`win32.`/`posix.` qualifier, so a BARE
 *    `resolve(`/`join(` imported from `node:path` is invisible to shape B's
 *    first arm. Measured on `clients/dispatch/runners/go-vet.ts`, whose import
 *    style is bare: the qualified needle matched 0 occurrences there and the
 *    bare call was the live one (#3278 criterion 4). Widening the qualifier
 *    here would pull `relative`/`join` calls in dozens of files into a census
 *    about KEY derivation, so the family that actually needed the bare form —
 *    "a runner compares a tool-reported path against the dispatched file" — is
 *    counted by its own detector instead:
 *    `tests/config/reported-path-attribution-sweep.test.ts`, whose
 *    `PATH_CALL_HERE` makes the qualifier optional.
 * 3. This sweep counts FOLDS THAT EXIST. A site with no fold at all presents
 *    nothing to count, which is why it could not see any of #3278's twelve
 *    members; absence in this family is the other detector's job.
