/**
 * #3071 — every `DegradationKind` literal emitted at a `recordDegradationOnce`
 * / `incrementDegradationCount` / `logDurableDegradation` call site is a
 * declared member of the `DegradationKind` union.
 *
 * ## The defect this guards
 *
 * `DegradationRecord.kind` is typed `unknown` and `DegradationGroup.kind` is
 * typed plain `string` (`clients/degradation-ledger.ts`) — nothing in the type
 * system ties a call site's `kind:` literal back to the union declared just
 * above them. `tests/config/degradation-kind-order.test.ts` pins the union's
 * own ALPHABETICAL order, but never checks that order against what call sites
 * actually emit, so a kind spelled at a call site with no matching union
 * member compiles clean and is silently unreachable by any reader (`pilens
 * degradation`, the durable ledger dashboard, a future exhaustive `switch`)
 * that trusts the union as the complete vocabulary.
 *
 * Measured on 4ff36009f (#3071's filing): declared 138, literal kinds at call
 * sites 112, undeclared 13. Measured again for this change (master had moved:
 * two more record sites were added in the interim — `lsp-document-drift`,
 * `lsp-probe-finding-policy`) — see the PR body for the exact 15-name list
 * this sweep found and `clients/degradation-ledger.ts` now declares.
 *
 * ## Scope, stated rather than silently narrowed
 *
 * This walks `clients/`, `index.ts`, `mcp/` and `tools/` (`commands/` too,
 * were it to exist) for a CALL EXPRESSION whose simple callee is one of the
 * three names, exactly like {@link
 * import("../support/sweep-kit.js").createCallSiteScanner} resolves any other
 * sweep's call sites — comments and string CONTENTS are blanked first
 * (`stripSource`) so a callee named only in prose is not a call. `scripts/`
 * is not walked: nothing there calls these three names directly (one bench
 * script only READS `getDegradationSummary()`), and record sites are 100%
 * inside the four scanned trees today (`stableOccurrenceKey`'s `#file:hash`
 * details below say exactly which file supplied each one).
 *
 * `kindLiteralsInOptions` extracts the STRING literal(s) the call's own
 * `kind:` property evaluates to, TEXTUALLY, and knows two shapes:
 * - a bare literal (`kind: "actionable-warnings-cap"`);
 * - a two-armed ternary between two literals (`clients/deadline-utils.ts`:
 *   `kind: fired === "deadline" ? "hook-await-exceeded" :
 *   "hook-await-abandoned"`) — both arms are returned, and the ternary's own
 *   CONDITION (here, the literal `"deadline"` being compared against) is
 *   deliberately excluded: only text after the `?` counts as a produced kind.
 *
 * A `kind` written as a PROPERTY ACCESS or FUNCTION CALL — a pass-through
 * parameter (`bounded-telemetry.ts`'s `options.ledgerKind`,
 * `bundled-resource-health.ts`'s `kind` parameter, `config-warn.ts`'s
 * `degradationKindFor(...)` classifier call, `instance-reaper.ts`'s
 * `options.kind`) or a whole record object built earlier and passed by name
 * (`index.ts`'s `incrementDegradationCount(degradation)`) — contributes NO
 * literal here: the literal, if any, lives at THAT function's own callers,
 * outside this scan's three names. This is a stated, not a silent, limit
 * (the "sweep is only as good as its needles" self-test below pins the
 * distinction), and it costs nothing for #3071's purpose: every one of those
 * pass-through sites resolves (by inspection, recorded in the PR body) to an
 * ALREADY-declared kind — `auditRegistry` treats a declared-but-unflagged
 * union member as fine by design (registries routinely cover state a
 * mechanical heuristic cannot see), so this sweep stays honest without
 * chasing multi-hop parameter forwarding.
 *
 * A `kind` written as a BARE IDENTIFIER (`TRUST_REFUSAL_KIND`, no `.`, no
 * `(`) is a DIFFERENT shape and is never silently dropped (#3140, the #3071
 * false-negative gap): `resolveSameFileConstKind` resolves it when it is a
 * SAME-FILE top-level `const NAME = "literal";`, one hop, never chased across
 * an import — the ONE rule this scan applies, not a per-site heuristic pile.
 * When that one hop does not resolve it (the binding is reached only through
 * an import — `PROCESS_SINGLETON_RESET_KIND`, folded in from
 * `clients/process-singletons.ts` below), the site must be named in
 * `AUDITED_IDENTIFIER_KIND_SITES` with its resolved kind, or the scan reports
 * it LOUD as `"<file>:<line> kind: <identifier> is unresolvable"` — never a
 * silent `[]`. A property access or function call is not put through this
 * same-file lookup: those are genuine pass-throughs whose value lives at a
 * DIFFERENT call site, and chasing them is the "multi-hop parameter
 * forwarding" this scan deliberately does not do.
 *
 * READ-TIME FOLD EMITTERS. `getDegradationSummary()` in
 * `clients/degradation-ledger.ts` (`LEDGER_FILE`) folds several kinds in at
 * READ time via `summary.push({ kind: ... })`
 * rather than through the three names above (`log-sink-write-failure`,
 * `log-sink-rotated`, `log-sink-rotate-failed`, `log-sink-option-conflict`,
 * `process-singleton-reset`, `global-dir-probe-redirect` — each one's own
 * `DegradationKind` doc comment explains why it cannot go through
 * `recordDegradation`). #3140: `process-singleton-reset` was live at this
 * exact path, undeclared, invisible to a scan that only walked the three
 * RECORD_CALLEES names — so this scan ALSO walks `LEDGER_FILE`'s own
 * `.push(...)` call sites (`LEDGER_PUSH_CALLEES`), scoped to that ONE file:
 * `push` is far too generic a callee name to walk across `clients/`, `mcp/`,
 * `tools/` (every array push would match), but within this single file every
 * `.push()` call is either `groups.entries.push(...)` (no `kind:` property —
 * `kindValueText` finds nothing and it is silently skipped, same as any other
 * call with no `kind:`) or one of these read-time-fold summary rows, verified
 * by inspection rather than by narrowing the pattern further.
