/**
 * Registered-or-fail guard for a test file's peak resident set (#3058).
 *
 * Recurrence this prevents: `tests/config/bounded-container-guard.test.ts`
 * merged on 2026-09-14 with a 9,226 MB peak — 4.5x the
 * `WORKER_PEAK_RSS_BUDGET_MB` the worker resolver divides the runner's memory
 * by — and nothing in the repo noticed. The suite's memory low-water fell
 * 8,532 MB and the Unit job's SIGKILL rate went 7.1% -> 30.4% over five days
 * before a human read the `[mem-file]` records by hand. `reportPeakRss` now
 * fails that file's own suite at the point the peak is measured; this file is
 * what keeps that gate honest.
