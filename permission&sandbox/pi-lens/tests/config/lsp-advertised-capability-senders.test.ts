/**
 * #3405: every capability `CLIENT_CAPABILITIES` advertises has a sender, or a
 * named admission saying why it has none.
 *
 * Recurrence this file prevents, exactly: `synchronization.didSave` was
 * advertised in the `initialize` handshake from #278 until #3405 and NO caller
 * ever emitted `textDocument/didSave`. Nothing could catch it — pi-lens's own
 * suite cannot see the difference, because the cost lands on the SERVER, which
 * changes its behaviour on the strength of the advertisement (Expert stopped
 * compiling on save for a client that claimed to send one). #3405 round 1's
 * review named the gap: the invariant went into AGENTS.md as prose, and
 * `tests/config/agents-governance.test.ts` checks that file's SHAPE, not this
 * population — AGENTS.md defect shape 34's own trap, a rule stated where no
 * check reads it.
 *
 * The population is read from the RUNTIME object, not from source text, so a
 * capability added to `CLIENT_CAPABILITIES` tomorrow is in this test's scope the
 * moment it is added. Every advertised leaf must carry a disposition below; an
 * unknown one fails rather than being skipped, which is what makes "advertise a
 * new capability with no sender" red.
 *
 * Detector policy (AGENTS.md "detectors match code, not prose"): the needle IS
 * a string literal — the wire method name — so the scan keeps strings and
 * blanks COMMENTS (`stripSource(..., { strings: "keep" })`). A comment or a
 * doc-block quoting `"textDocument/didSave"` therefore cannot satisfy the
 * requirement; only a literal in code can.

 * OBJECT advertises as soon as it has one key, even when every key inside it is
 * `false`: per LSP the PRESENCE of the capability object is the signal a server
 * reads, and its fields only modify it — `completion: { dynamicRegistration:
 * false, completionItem: { snippetSupport: false } }` tells a server this client
 * does completion, which is exactly the kind of claim this file exists to make
 * someone answer for. An empty object (`window: {}`) advertises nothing.
