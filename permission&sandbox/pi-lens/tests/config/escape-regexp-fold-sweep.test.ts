/**
 * #2558: forbid a NEW copy of the regex-escaping helper outside
 * `clients/string-utils.ts`.
 *
 * Before this issue, `escapeRegExp` (and near-namesakes `escapeRegExpChar`,
 * `escapeRegExpLiteral`, and a renamed `escapeRegex`) was hand-copied into
 * eight production modules and four test helpers, all with the byte-identical
 * body `x.replace(/[.*+?^${}()|[\]\\]/g, "\\$&")` — found by grepping the
 * NAME (`function escapeRegExp`), which a renamed copy trivially evades
 * (`scripts/lib/astgrep-self-scan.mjs` shipped exactly that: `escapeRegex`,
 * same body, different name). `clients/string-utils.ts` now owns the one
 * runtime copy and `tests/support/sweep-kit.ts` re-exports it for the test
 * side; every former copy imports from one of those instead.
 *
 * This sweep matches the ESCAPING BODY, not the function's name (AGENTS.md
 * defect shape 38 — "cheapest evasion" screen: a guard that only matches a
 * name is defeated by a rename that keeps the body). It flags two shapes,
 * both meaning "a reusable escaping helper duplicates this body":
 *
 *   A. `function <name>(<param>) { ... return <param>.replace(<escape>); }`
 *   B. `(<param>) => <param>.replace(<escape>)` (arrow, parenthesized or
 *      bare single param) — this is also how `feature-hints.ts`'s inline
 *      `.map((token) => token.replace(...))` copy read before its fold, so
 *      an inline arrow callback counts as a "definition" too.
 *
 * Round 2 (F1): the scan tree used to stop at `clients`/`tools`/`mcp`/`tests`
 * with only `.ts`, so the very recurrence this file's header names —
 * `scripts/lib/astgrep-self-scan.mjs`'s renamed `escapeRegex` — was outside
 * the swept tree and a reintroduction there passed silently. `scripts` is now
 * scanned too, with `.mjs` added to the extensions (never bare `.js`: a bare
 * `.js` would also match compiled output sitting next to its `.ts` source —
 * `clients/string-utils.js` itself — and self-flag the canonical file's own
 * build artifact as a second "copy" of its own body).
 *
 * It deliberately does NOT flag a bare inline `value.replace(<escape>)` that
 * is not itself a function/arrow body — e.g. `const escapedSha =
 * mergeSha.replace(...)` in `scripts/lib/merge-train-lane.mjs`, and the same
 * shape in `scripts/rollup-changelog.mjs`, `scripts/run-all-ts-rules-posthog.mjs`,
 * and `scripts/lib/compat-contracts.mjs`: each is a single one-off
 * computation at its own call site, not a copy-pasted HELPER. These four
 * specifically stay un-folded (not merely un-flagged) because
 * `merge-train-lane.mjs`'s workflow (`.github/workflows/merge-train-lane.yml`)
 * runs `node scripts/merge-train-lane.mjs` directly with no `npm install`/
 * `npm run build` step before it, so importing the compiled
 * `clients/string-utils.js` there would 404 that job; the other three keep
 * the same one-off shape for consistency rather than for their own
 * build-order reason. (Round 2 F3: three PLAIN test-side one-offs that
 * looked like the same case — `tests/clients/deps-centralization.test.ts`,
 * `tests/clients/config-deprecation-registry.test.ts`,
 * `tests/support/public-surface-drift.ts` — turned out to have no such
 * constraint and are folded onto the `sweep-kit.js` re-export instead.)
 *
 * A DIFFERENT character class is a variant, not a copy, and stays out of
 * this sweep's reach on purpose: `clients/file-utils.ts`'s `globToRegExp`
 * omits `*` and `?` from the escaped set because its caller handles those
 * two glob wildcards itself immediately afterward.
 *
 * Uses `stripSource(..., { strings: "keep" })` (`tests/support/sweep-kit.ts`)
 * so comments are blanked (a fake definition written only in a comment must
 * not count — the #1635/#1692 comment-laundering shape) while regex literals
 * and string contents are preserved (the default "blank" policy blanks
 * regex bodies too, which would erase the very escape sequence this sweep
 * matches on).
