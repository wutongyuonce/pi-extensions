/**
 * #3278 acceptance criterion 3 — the ABSENCE detector for the runner
 * reported-path-identity family.
 *
 * `tests/config/path-key-fold-sweep.test.ts` enumerates existing case FOLDS, so
 * a site with NO fold at all presents nothing to count: measured while fixing
 * #3277, mutating `go-vet.ts` to a hand-rolled `toLowerCase` compare left that
 * sweep GREEN. Eleven members of this family were invisible to it for exactly
 * that reason. This sweep counts the opposite thing — every runner or tool-client
 * site that still answers "is this reported diagnostic about the dispatched
 * file?" with its OWN predicate instead of the seam — and pins the census
 * shrink-only.
 *
 * The recurrence it prevents is #209 / #3277 / #3278: a runner compares the
 * tool's spelling of the edited file against the dispatcher's with `===`,
 * `!==`, `endsWith` or a basename, so a spelling that differs only in case
 * (the SAME file on Windows and on a case-folding POSIX mount) drops every
 * finding for that file and the run is reported clean — or, in the `endsWith`
 * and basename directions, a DIFFERENT file's finding is attributed to it. The
 * sanctioned spelling is
 * `pathsEqual(path.resolve(<the cwd the tool ran in>, reported), absTarget)`.
 *
 * It also closes `path-key-fold-sweep`'s `PATH_CALL` blind spot for this
 * family (#3278 criterion 4): that needle requires a `path.`/`win32.`/`posix.`
 * qualifier, and several runners import `resolve`/`join` BARE from
 * `node:path` — measured on `go-vet.ts`, where the qualified needle matched 0
 * and the bare call was the live one. `PATH_CALL_HERE` below matches both.
 *
 * Detector hygiene (AGENTS.md defect shape 38): the scan runs over
 * comment-and-string-blanked source, so a comment or string copy of the needle
 * can neither create a finding nor launder one away. A comparison against a
 * blanked string LITERAL is skipped by a per-needle policy documented at
 * `LITERAL_OPERAND` — lowercasing or comparing a basename against `".bin"` or
 * `"dockerfile"` is file-KIND detection, a different transformation with a
 * different correctness argument.

 * missed a member. Round 1 listed the location captures it knew
 * (`:(\d+):(\d+)`) and missed `shellcheck`'s `item.file` and `trivy-config`'s
 * `resultEntry.Target`. Round 2 listed those two JSON fields BY NAME and missed
 * `stylelint`'s `result.source`, which a real `dispatchForFile` probe delivered
 * as the dispatched file — plus `vale`'s map KEY, `rubocop`'s `file.path`,
 * `eslint`'s `fileResult.filePath`, `biome-check`'s `d.location.path`,
 * `tflint`'s `issue.range.filename`, `swiftlint`/`ktlint`/`hadolint`'s
 * `item.file`, `actionlint`'s `issue.filepath`, `spellcheck`'s `parsed.path`,
 * `sqlfluff`'s `item.filepath`, `markdownlint`'s `^.*?:` prefix, `php-lint`'s
 * `in <file> on line`, and the SHARED diagnostic factory in
 * `utils/diagnostic-parsers.ts`, whose own docstring says the regex "Must
 * capture: [fullMatch, file?, line?, col?, ...]" and which then drops
 * `match[1]` on the floor.
 *
 * A list of field names can only ever catch the fields someone remembered. So
 * this detector names NO path field and NO location shape. A file is a member
 * when all three hold:
 *
 * 1. it CONSTRUCTS a diagnostic — an object literal carrying `tool:` (the
 *    `Diagnostic` discriminator every runner and the shared factory write) that
 *    also carries a `filePath` property;
 * 2. that `filePath` is the DISPATCHED path, not something read out of the
 *    tool's output — either `ctx.filePath`, or an identifier this file never
 *    declares, which is therefore the parse function's own path PARAMETER;
 * 3. it PARSES tool output ({@link PARSE_MARKERS}), and
 * 4. it holds no `pathsEqual(` call in comment-and-string-blanked source.
 *
 * Direction 2 is what separates a blanket stamp from the attribute policy:
 * `mypy.ts` writes the same `filePath,` shorthand, but over a LOCAL
 * `const filePath = path.resolve(cwd, reported)`, so its declaration is right
 * there in the file and the site reads as what it is. Same for `spotbugs.ts`'s
 * `let filePath` from `<SourceLine sourcepath=…>`. `helm-lint.ts`,
 * `credo.ts`, `phpstan.ts`, `ruff.ts`, `pyright.ts` and `lsp.ts` write a
 * non-identifier expression that reads the reported path, and are non-members
 * for the same reason.
 *
 * KNOWN LIMIT, pinned rather than papered over: this detector cannot prove the
 * OPERANDS of a `pathsEqual(` call. A runner that called `pathsEqual` on two
 * unrelated paths would launder itself out of this census. That direction is
 * covered by the sibling census in this file (which counts local predicates,
 * and would flag a hand-rolled compare) and by the per-member own-file /
 * sibling-file cells in
 * `tests/clients/dispatch/runners/reported-path-attribution.test.ts`, whose
 * mutation signature is the delivered diagnostic, not the call's spelling.
 * `LAUNDERING_LIMIT` below asserts the limit so it cannot be forgotten.

/**
 * Exact shrink-only pin for parsers the inverted detector flags that are NOT

 * reason MEASURED from the runner's own source — never a silent skip, so a file
 * that grows a real reported path here presents a count of 1 against a pin of 1
 * and the per-runner dispatch cells are what must then change.
 *
 * - `fish-indent.ts@1` — `/\(line\s+(\d+)\)/` over the first non-blank stderr
 *   line. The matched span holds a parse POSITION and no path token;
 *   `fish_indent --check` is handed exactly one file.
 * - `shfmt.ts@1` — `/^@@\s+-(\d+)/m` over a unified diff BODY. The only path in
 *   `--diff` output is the `---`/`+++` echo of our own argv, which this parser
 *   never reads.
 * - `prisma-validate.ts@1` — `/:(\d+)(?::\d+)?\b/` over the whole output, with
 *   no path token in the matched span. Adding a path capture would change which
 *   `:N` in a free-form error wins, on a format this tree holds no captured
 *   upstream vector for.
 * - `psscriptanalyzer.ts@1` — the runner's own `PS_SCRIPT` runs
 *   `Select-Object RuleName,Severity,Line,Column,Message`, so the path is
 *   PROJECTED AWAY before `ConvertTo-Json`: no path can reach the parser.
 * - `ruff.ts@1` — flagged by ARM (b) in round 4: it hands `ctx.filePath` to
 *   `parseRuffOutput`, the shared factory's product, and holds no `pathsEqual`
 *   of its own. Both of its arms are covered: the JSON arm attributes each
 *   diagnostic to `item.filename || filePath` (the reported path, not a blanket
 *   stamp), and the TEXT arm delegates to `parseRuffOutput`, whose predicate
 *   lives in `utils/diagnostic-parsers.ts` — itself in this census population,
 *   so removing it reds there — and is mutation-proved by the
 *   `diagnostic-parsers` cells in
 *   `tests/clients/dispatch/runners/reported-path-attribution.test.ts`.
 * - `phpstan.ts@1` — the flagged stamp is the `output.errors[]` arm, phpstan's
 *   FILE-INDEPENDENT findings (internal errors, ignore patterns that matched
 *   nothing). Those carry no file at all and attach to the edited file at line 1
 *   by the documented #1937-round-2 decision. The `output.files` arm right above
 *   it already attributes each error to its OWN key resolved against the runner
 *   cwd (#265 A3), which is the attribute policy, not a blanket stamp.
