// Recurrence: #2940. 9183f39c6 changed release.yml's "Pin npm" step from
// `npm install -g npm@<pin>` to `npx -y npm@<pin> --version` and routed the
// INSTALL step through `npx`, but left `npm publish` bare — so the publish job
// ran Node 22's bundled npm, which has no OIDC trusted-publishing support.
// Nothing failed until the v4.1.6 release run (34530690014, 2026-09-10):
// tag and GitHub release created, then
// `npm error 404 Not Found - PUT https://registry.npmjs.org/pi-lens`.
// Recovered by #2938. The exact pre-fix file is checked in at
// tests/fixtures/workflows/release-9183f39c6.yml (byte-identical to
// `git show 9183f39c6:.github/workflows/release.yml`) and is the red vector
// below — CI checks out at depth 1, so the historical object is NOT reachable
// from a test and the vector has to be a committed fixture.
//
// Two scans, two string policies, deliberately (the sweep-kit
// `strings: "preserve" | "blank"` distinction, applied to shell):
//   - the SATISFY direction (which step carries the pinned invocation, which
//     step asserts the version) reads comment-blanked text with strings
//     INTACT, because the pinned invocation's own `"npm@${npm_pin}"` is a
//     quoted token, not prose;
//   - the TRIP direction (is there a bare `npm <verb>`) reads `lexShell`'s
//     fully lexed text, where a comment or an `echo "... npm run ..."` string
//     cannot masquerade as a command.
// A comment quoting `npm publish` therefore neither trips the rule nor
// satisfies it.
