/**
 * #1892 witness (ADR 0007) — the SECRETS LANE through the pi HOST entry.
 *
 * The lane extraction (`clients/turn-end/lanes/secrets.ts`) moved every
 * gitleaks/trivy-secrets rendering and disposition rule out of
 * `clients/runtime-turn.ts` with no agent-facing change, so the evidence that
 * matters is a committed artifact of what the agent actually receives. This
 * drives `index.ts`'s real registered `session_start` / `turn_start` /
 * `tool_result` / `turn_end` / `context` handlers and diffs the rendered
 * context message against
 * `tests/fixtures/witness/turn-end-lane-secrets/live-stale-marked.txt`.
 *
 * It covers, in ONE turn, every behaviour the lane owns and the one thing it
 * hands back to the composer:
 *   - a live gitleaks secret, unified with the ast-grep rule that flags the
 *     SAME line, in one 🔴 row with combined provenance (#131 Mode 3);
 *   - a trivy secret from the sibling store in the SAME section — the reason
 *     "gitleaks" is not a separable lane;
 *   - a gitleaks finding whose file was edited after the scan, in the 🔑 tier
 *     with its rule id and no line (#1622 M1/M2);
 *   - a gitleaks finding marked false-positive: gone from both tiers, present
 *     in the one suppressed-by-disposition notice as `gitleaks 1` (#1616);
 *   - the delivered-location set the lane builds: the ast-grep warning on the
 *     SAME line folds into the blocker's provenance, the one three lines down
 *     does not (`[gitleaks + ast-grep]` vs `[gitleaks]` under mutation).
 *
 * What it does NOT witness: the composer's own read of that set (it filters
 * the duplicate ast-grep row out of the actionable-warnings advisory). That
 * advisory renders nothing in this harness — `report.summary.unsuppressed`
 * stays 0 for injected dispatch warnings — so the section cannot appear
 * whether the filter runs or not. Pre-existing gap, named in the PR body, not
 * papered over with a fixture that only looks like a pin.
 *
 * The only doubles are process boundaries: `clients/pipeline.js` (it spawns
 * every configured linter, and is how a dispatch warning reaches the runtime)
 * and the scanner RESULT caches, written through the REAL `CacheManager` into
 * the project's real cache directory — exactly what a session_start scan
 * leaves behind. The cache manager, the coordinator, the freshness gate, the
 * disposition store, the lane and the context injection are all real.
