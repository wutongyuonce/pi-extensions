// #2530 round 4 F2: scripts/rekey-hook-await-exemptions.mjs and
// scripts/lib/ts-sibling-loader.mjs shipped with no tests at all. Round 4
// F1 found the matching logic could silently launder a stale exemption
// reason onto a brand-new, unrelated flagged await — a hole a test would
// have caught immediately. These pin the fixed matching algorithm
// (`buildRekeyPlan`) directly, via synthetic key lists (no real files, no
// child process for a-c), plus one integration test (d) that spawns the
// real CLI to prove the JavaScript scan seam works under a bare `node`
// process without Node's optional built-in TypeScript support.
