/**
 * Tests for the SHARED-SLOT half of scripts/lib/suite-lock.mjs (#2435).
 *
 * The exclusive lock (#1101) is covered by suite-lock.test.ts; this file
 * pins only the slot arithmetic the shared mode adds, because that
 * arithmetic is what decides whether a full `npm test` can end up sharing
 * the box with targeted runs — the exact condition #2435 blames for 27-69
 * unreproducible timeout failures per local full run.
 *
 * Three properties are load-bearing and each has its own case:
 *   1. an EXCLUSIVE acquisition waits until every shared slot has drained;
 *   2. a SHARED acquisition waits while the exclusive lock is held;
 *   3. a slot whose recorded PID is dead is reclaimed immediately.
 * Plus the one failure mode that would poison the machine lock forever: an
 * exclusive holder whose drain times out must not leave its lock file
 * behind.
 *
 * All paths are under `fs.mkdtemp()` with short poll intervals — never the
 * real `~/.pi-lens`, and no environment variable is read or written.
