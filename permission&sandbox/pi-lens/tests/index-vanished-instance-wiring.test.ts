/**
 * End-to-end wiring guard for the #1123 item 2 vanished-instance marker: a
 * REAL session_start (registerInstance/sweepOrphans path untouched) against a
 * registry file seeded with a dead-pid entry must log the marker line BEFORE
 * sweepOrphans prunes that same entry — the two must not race the other way,
 * or the vanished set would already be empty by the time the marker runs.
 *
 * `logSessionStart` is spied (not the real writer, which no-ops under
 * `isTestMode()` — see clients/sessionstart-logger.ts) so the exact line is
 * observable without depending on real sessionstart.log I/O.
 *
 * Two mechanisms make the assertions below deterministic. Both are stated
 * here because #3042 is what a WRONG version of this paragraph cost:
 *
 * 1. LIVENESS. `process.kill(pid, 0)` is the ONE liveness seam this path
 *    uses — `clients/instance-reaper.ts`'s `realIsPidAlive` is the single
 *    liveness function, and both consumers reached from session_start take
 *    it (`logVanishedInstances`'s default argument, and
 *    `decideOrphanReaping`'s). The OS process-table queries in that file
 *    (`queryCommandLines`/`findPidsByMarkerWindows`) only ever run over a
 *    registry entry's recorded `lspChildren`, and the fixture below records
 *    none. So spying `process.kill` genuinely settles the synthetic pid's
 *    liveness on every path the sweep takes, whatever the runner's process
 *    table says about that number.
 *
 * 2. THE REGISTRY FILE. Since #2912 `PI_LENS_HOME` is ONE directory for the
 *    whole vitest run (`<repo>/.probe-home`), not a per-worker temp dir, so
 *    `instances.json` and its `.lock` are shared by every test file running
 *    concurrently. The reaper's prune is best-effort: it gives up after
 *    `withInstanceRegistryLock`'s 500 ms deadline and returns
 *    "could-not-acquire", which `instance-reaper.ts` discards. Asserting
 *    that write against the run-shared registry therefore reds whenever
 *    sibling forks happen to hold the lock — #3042, reproduced with
 *    `PRUNE-RESULT could-not-acquire` under eight concurrent holders. Each
 *    case below runs against its OWN `PI_LENS_HOME` instead, which also
 *    stops this fixture clobbering the registry those siblings are using.
