/**
 * Resolves the skills directory the `resources_discover` handler (#205)
 * registers, and reports the one condition that pi previously loaded with NO
 * visible signal: `<packageRoot>/skills` is absent, unreadable, or holds no
 * skill pi's own loader would find (#2626).
 *
 * `resolvePackagePath(import.meta.url, "skills")`-equivalent resolution
 * (`clients/package-root.ts`'s `getPackageRoot`) is correct for both the
 * source and compiled `dist/` layouts — it walks up from the loaded entry
 * file to the nearest `package.json`. It goes wrong silently, not loudly,
 * when that walk lands somewhere with no `skills/` beside it: `skills/`
 * missing from an installed package, or the entry file copied out of the
 * package tree by a managed extension cache so the nearest `package.json`
 * is the cache's own. Either way `resources_discover` used to hand pi a
 * path that does not exist, `pi` registered zero skills, and nothing — no
 * extension error, no stderr line — said so (investigated on #2587).
 *
 * #2626 review round 2, F1: the FIRST version of this fix inverted the
 * acceptance criterion — it returned `[]` (no skills registered) whenever
 * its own predicate disagreed with pi's real loader, which is worse than
 * the bug it fixed on every layout the predicate got wrong (dropping skills
 * pi WOULD have loaded, a regression vs. pre-fix `master`). The acceptance
 * criteria ask for a RECORD, never a changed return value: this module
 * returns `[skillsDir]` UNCONDITIONALLY, exactly like the pre-fix handler —
 * pi's own `loadSkills`/`collectSkillEntries` already treat a nonexistent
 * path as zero skills from that entry, gracefully, so handing it a path
 * that turns out to be empty is exactly as safe as `master`'s behavior
 * always was. The health check below is PURELY observational.
 *
 * #2636 review F4: the ENOENT/EACCES classification shell below used to be
 * hand-rolled here, character-identical to the ast-grep/tree-sitter sites
 * #2636 fixed for the same silent-zero shape — now shared via
 * `bundled-resource-health.ts`, with `scanEntriesForSkills` supplied as this
 * module's own "what counts as found" predicate.
