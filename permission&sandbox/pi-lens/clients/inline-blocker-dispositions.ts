/**
 * Disposition/rule/inline-suppression policy for the turn-end
 * "Unresolved from this turn" blocker replay (#3246).
 *
 * `runtime-turn.ts` re-serves every live `InlineBlockerRecord` the turn's
 * dispatches left behind. Until this module, it pushed the record's
 * ALREADY-RENDERED `summary` string verbatim, so a `lens_diagnostic_mark`
 * made after the record was written had nothing to act on: the durable
 * disposition store was honored by `lens_diagnostics`, the widget, the cached
 * scanner lanes, late auxiliary and cascade, while this one surface replayed
 * the pre-mark text on every later turn — including turns that edited only an
 * unrelated file. That is #3246's report.
 *
 * The fix is the same shape `blocker-past-eof.ts` already argued for the
 * `lines` field: carry the STRUCTURED diagnostics the summary was rendered
 * from (`dispatchResult.blockers`, via `PipelineResult.inlineBlockerDiagnostics`
 * and `InlineBlockerRecord.diagnostics`) and re-derive at read time, rather
 * than regex-parsing a string built for human display. With the diagnostics in
 * hand this module runs the ONE filter stack every other findings surface runs
 * — `clients/dispatch/finding-policy.ts`'s inline `pi-lens-ignore` → stored
 * dispositions → `.pi-lens.json` rule policy — against the file's CURRENT
 * bytes, and re-renders the survivors with `formatDiagnostics(..., "blocking")`,
 * the SAME renderer `dispatcher.ts` used to build the stored summary. No second
 * anchor implementation and no second renderer: an unmarked record therefore
 * re-renders byte-identically to what dispatch produced.
 *
 * Ordering (#3246 mutation (c)): the policy runs over the WHOLE candidate set
 * and `formatDiagnostics` applies its 10-row display cap to the survivors.
 * Filtering after the cap would leave a marked finding occupying a display slot
 * and hide an unmarked one behind "... and N more" — the cap-before-policy
 * shape `cascade-format.ts` already avoids.
