/**
 * Shared write-plumbing for the hand-rolled NDJSON debug loggers in clients/.
 *
 * One buffered async writer replaces eight drifting copies of append+rotate.
 * `log()`/`append()` are synchronous-call, async-write: they enqueue a
 * serialized line and a single in-flight `fs.promises.appendFile` drains the
 * queue — no `appendFileSync` on the per-edit hot path (latency-logger alone
 * fired ~10–20 sync appends per edit, #454/#361/#368).
 *
 * Errors are swallowed best-effort, matching every current logger. A
 * best-effort SYNC flush is registered on `process.on("exit")` (appendFileSync
 * is fine at exit — not the hot path; no child spawning, #234). Normal drains
 * use promise-based mkdir/append/truncate, while rotation stays synchronous
 * inside the already-deferred drain so it cannot race a flushSync rename. A
 * The shared writer state uses the `NDJSON_GLOBAL_STATE_SCHEMA` protocol:
 * version 1 (the 6a8a0994 shape) is upgraded in place to current version 2,
 * retaining its queues while replacing stale exit flushers. A pre-7e4b9120
 * private-queue shape is fenced rather than adopted, because its queues cannot
 * be migrated safely.

/**
 * Decide what this append writes, rotating first when the file already on
 * disk leaves no room. Two things have to hold, and the pre-#2505 write path
 * did neither:
 *
 *  1. The bound is checked against the size this write PRODUCES, not only
 *     the size already on disk — otherwise the write that crosses the bound
 *     is always allowed through and only the NEXT one rotates (one write
 *     late), which on a long-lived or idle-tailed session (the warm MCP
 *     server never re-runs the session-start sweep in `log-cleanup.ts`) may
 *     be a long time or never.
 *  2. The batch ITSELF is capped at the bound. Rotation only ever moves
 *     PRE-EXISTING content aside, so an oversized batch written whole into
 *     an empty (or just-rotated) file lands past the bound with nothing left
 *     to rotate away: a 500-line drain against a 1KB bound landed at ~107KB,
 *     106x over, with zero rotations. Capping makes the drain loop come back
 *     around for the remainder instead.
 *
 * A single NDJSON line is atomic and cannot be split, so at least one line
 * is always taken: the enforced invariant is "the bound plus at most one
 * line", never "the bound plus an unbounded batch".
