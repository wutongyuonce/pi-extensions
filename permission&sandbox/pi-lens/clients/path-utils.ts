/**
 * Normalize a file path for consistent Map key usage.
 *
 * On Windows:
 * - If the file exists: uses realpathSync.native() to get the canonical
 *   filesystem path (actual casing, resolved symlinks)
 * - If the file doesn't exist: resolves the path and lowercases
 *   (needed for new files where we haven't written yet)
 *
 * On POSIX:
 * - Folds `.`, `..` and duplicate separators first (#3184, see below).
 * - If the file exists: adopts the on-disk CASING of the trailing segments
 *   (see `adoptCanonicalCasing`) — no lowercasing, no symlink resolution.
 * - If the file doesn't exist: returns the path as-is, case-PRESERVING. On a
 *   case-sensitive filesystem `SUB/a.ts` and `sub/a.ts` are two different
 *   files, and nothing may fold one into the other; only the filesystem's own
 *   answer for a path that EXISTS can tell the two apart, and for a path that
 *   does not exist there is no such answer to ask for.
 *
 * Why the POSIX arm folds dot segments (#3184): the casing arm returns the
 * caller's own spelling whenever `adoptCanonicalCasing` changes nothing, and
 * for `<base>/src/../src/a.ts` it always changes nothing — `realpath` answers
 * a string with FEWER segments, which a casing-only rewrite cannot express, so
 * it declines and the caller's un-folded spelling came back as the map key.
 * Every canonical writer keys through `path.resolve` first (`ctx.filePath` =
 * `normalizeMapKey(resolveAgainstAncestors(...))`, `clients/dispatch/
 * runner-context.ts:49`), so a consumer that passes an ALREADY-absolute
 * agent-typed path straight in (`tools/lens-diagnostic-mark.ts`,
 * `clients/mcp/analyze.ts`) derived an orphan key that no reader could reach.
 * Folding here is pure string algebra — no cwd, no filesystem — so a relative
 * path stays relative (`src/../x` → `x`, `../x` → `../x`, never resolved
 * against `process.cwd()`; refs #2490, where a cwd fold broke every monorepo)
 * and a symlinked package still keys under the path the caller held. These
 * are `path.resolve`'s own TEXTUAL `..` semantics, which is exactly what
 * makes a folded reader key equal to the canonical writer's key: where a
 * `..` sits right after a symlinked directory, textual folding and the
 * kernel disagree, and both sides of every comparison take the textual
 * answer because every canonical writer already resolved that way.
 *
 * Why POSIX canonicalizes casing at all (#3098, the #1024 defect's live half):
 * a case-insensitive POSIX filesystem — macOS's default APFS, `nocase` vfat /
 * ntfs3 / cifs mounts — makes `SUB/a.ts` and `sub/a.ts` ONE file, so a raw
 * mis-cased write (`lens_diagnostic_mark` anchors under `path.resolve(cwd,
 * arg)`) and a `normalizeMapKey` read derived two anchors for one file and the
 * agent's own disposition mark silently never applied. A case-preserving POSIX
 * arm cannot close that: the two keys only become one if the normalizer asks
 * the filesystem which name is really on disk.
 *
 * `realpathSync.native` is `realpath(3)`. On Darwin it rebuilds every
 * component from the filesystem's own `ATTR_CMN_NAME` — Libc-1669.0.4
 * `stdlib/FreeBSD/realpath.c:233` (`getattrlist(resolved, &_rp_alist, …,
 * FSOPT_NOFOLLOW)` with `ATTR_CMN_NAME`) and `:348-354` ("attrs already has
 * the real name") — which is why it returns on-disk casing on APFS/HFS+.
 * MEASURED counter-example (#3098): a Linux ext4/tmpfs `chattr +F` casefold
 * directory aliases the two spellings but `realpath(3)` there returns the
 * spelling the caller asked with, so this arm is a no-op on casefolded Linux
 * directories — filed with the transcript as #3154.
 *
 * Always converts backslashes to forward slashes for consistent Map keys.

/**
 * Does `relativePath` — a `/`-separated path relative to the workspace root —
 * match one declared workspace-member (or workspace-exclude) `pattern` under
 * `dialect`?
 *
 * This is the ONE workspace-member matcher (#2591). `clients/lsp/server.ts`'s
 * `cargoWorkspaceDeclaresMember` and `clients/python-environment.ts`'s
 * `isUvWorkspaceMember` are thin callers of it; neither keeps a private segment
 * compiler or minimatch options block any more.
 *
 * `clients/review-graph/workspace-modules.ts`'s `expandWorkspacePattern` is
 * deliberately NOT a caller: npm/pnpm `workspaces` entries are EXPANDED against
 * the filesystem (one `readdir` of the directory preceding the first `*`,
 * yielding the directories that exist and hold a manifest) rather than tested
 * against a candidate path. It answers "which directories does this pattern
 * name", not "does this pattern name this directory"; folding it in would mean
 * giving this pure function a filesystem.
 *
 * The supported syntax is the intersection of the two upstream dialects: `*`,
 * `?`, `**`, `[abc]`/`[!abc]` (dialect-gated), and literals. minimatch-only
 * extensions the pre-fold uv path inherited by accident — brace expansion,
 * extglobs, leading-`!` negation, leading-`#` comments — are NOT honored, and
 * uv's own `glob` crate does not honor them either (same pinned SHA), so
 * dropping them moves uv toward upstream rather than away from it.
 *
 * Matching is NON-BACKTRACKING (#2603): the pattern compiles to a list of
 * bounded steps and {@link matchesWorkspaceMemberSteps} decides it with one
 * memoized (step, position) table, O(steps x characters), no matter how many
 * `**`s the pattern carries. The anchored whole-path regex this replaced was
 * correct but explored 2^N splits of a non-matching path for N `**`
 * components — 124900 ms for `("**\/*" x12)/zzz` against a 40-component path,
 * on a call `detectPythonEnvironment` awaits with no timeout, i.e. a wedged
 * turn rather than a slow answer. The wall-clock half of that fix lives in
 * `tests/clients/workspace-glob-nonbacktracking-budget.test.ts`; the answers
 * are unchanged, pinned by the dialect table and the minimatch differential in
 * `tests/clients/path-utils.test.ts`.
 *
 * A pattern that cannot be compiled at all answers `false` for every path —
 * it declares no member and excludes nothing (#2591 review round 2, F2). The
 * only such patterns today carry an empty character-class range (`[z-a]`:
 * legal glob, illegal JS RegExp). Reachability note, recorded rather than
 * assumed away: no such pattern can reach here through a manifest right now,
 * because `parseTomlStringArray` (`clients/cargo-manifest.ts`) captures an
 * array body non-greedily up to the FIRST `]`, so any entry containing a `]`
 * loses its closing quote and is dropped before it becomes a pattern. That is
 * a property of the TOML reader, not of this matcher, and it is not this
 * function's to rely on — the character-class axis stays because upstream
 * cargo and uv both support classes, and the reader's gap may be closed later.
