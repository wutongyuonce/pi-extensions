/**
 * Cross-process LSP budget (#449 slice 2 — PROTOTYPE).
 *
 * Slice 1 (#472/#474/#475, `clients/instance-registry.ts` +
 * `clients/instance-reaper.ts`) made every concurrent pi-lens process visible
 * to every other one via `~/.pi-lens/instances.json`. This module is the
 * first thing that DOES something with that visibility: a machine-wide cap
 * on total live LSP server processes. When a NEW session starts and the
 * machine is already over budget, it degrades its OWN spawn plan — it never
 * touches another instance's already-running servers.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT a clearinghouse: no negotiation, no reservation, no
 * cross-process locking. Each session reads the registry once at
 * `session_start`, decides locally, and moves on — a "position limit," per
 * the issue's own framing, not shared ownership of anyone else's servers.
 *
 * Degrade mechanism chosen for this first slice: skip spawning AUXILIARY LSP
 * servers (role:"auxiliary" in clients/lsp/server.ts — opengrep, ast-grep,
 * zizmor, typos, marksman) for the remainder of THIS session, keeping only
 * the primary language server per file. Auxiliaries are cross-cutting
 * scanners layered on top of (not required for) core diagnostics, so this is
 * the cheapest, highest-signal thing to shed under machine-wide pressure.
 * The cached decision also shortens this session's idle reset and lets
 * pull-capable servers skip their push fallback. All three degrade mechanisms
 * read the same session-boundary snapshot; pressure never changes mid-touch.
 *
 * Ceiling default (`DEFAULT_LSP_BUDGET_CEILING = 16`): a rough RAM-budget
 * back-of-envelope, not a measured figure (#620's CPU/RSS sampling had not
 * landed as of this prototype) — assume ~250MB average RSS per live LSP
 * child process (typescript-language-server/pyright cold-index spikes
 * higher, short-lived auxiliaries like typos-lsp are much lighter, so this
 * is a rough blend) against a soft target of ~4GB machine-wide dedicated to
 * the LSP fleet: 4000MB / 250MB ≈ 16. Deliberately conservative-permissive
 * for a first cut — the goal is to catch the "25 concurrent node.exe, several
 * at 600MB-2GB RSS" pathological pile-up this was written in response to
 * (dogfooding note, 2026-07-12/13), not to micromanage the common 2-4-agent
 * case. `PI_LENS_LSP_BUDGET_CEILING` overrides it once real-world data (#620)
 * says otherwise.
 *
 * Kill switch: `PI_LENS_CROSS_PROCESS_BUDGET=0` disables this module
 * entirely (every session always spawns its full fleet, today's behavior) —
 * lazy env read, never memoized, matching the house style
 * (session-lifecycle.ts / runtime-config.ts).
