 *
 * Both call sites of {@link dispatchPipelineAnalysis} consult this, so the

 *
 * Check-then-act here has to be atomic against the microtask queue.
 * `dispatchPipelineAnalysis` registers synchronously before its own first
 * await, so a caller that claims and then dispatches with no `await` in between
 * cannot be interleaved. An `async` pre-check would reintroduce exactly that
 * interleave — both racers see an empty registry, both resume, both dispatch —
 * so the join's `await` is deliberately left to the caller.
 *
 * ## Why this is NOT folded into `dispatchPipelineAnalysis`
 *
 * On the classified chain the latch check sits ABOVE `addModifiedRange` and
 * `recordProjectChange`. Moving it down into the helper would write
 * `turn-state.json` ranges and an attributed change-log receipt for a state
 * already analysed this turn — the duplicate-recording inversion #2464 exists

	// makes PERSIST_AFTER_OBSERVATIONS unreachable again.
	//
	// ## What this return skips, stated in full (round 4, S4; #2464)
	//
	// The first cut called this "skipping turn tracking" and returned. It skipped
	// considerably more than turn tracking, and THREE of those steps have no
	// counterpart in `recordMutationThroughSeam`, so nothing else ran them. Those
	// three run here, before the return:
	//
	//   - the #2402 applied-edit records — without them an identical retry of
	//     the observed tool's edit escalates through the oldText-not-found ladder
	//     instead of being recognized as already applied;
	//   - `recordMutationToolReceipt`, the write→edit sticky turn transition,
	//     which is pure ordering state the bridge never touches;
	//   - the `cachedExports` refresh — without it the pre-write STOP check keeps
	//     firing on names this very edit removed.
	//
	// What stays skipped is skipped because the BRIDGE already did it: the
	// read-guard staleness stamp, the `turn-state.json` modified ranges, the
	// attributed change-log receipt, and the deferred autofix/format pair —
	// `recordMutationThroughSeam` steps 1-4. #2464 pulled the pipeline's own
	// lint/diagnostics dispatch (`dispatchPipelineAnalysis`, defined above) out
	// of the block below that also writes those same turn-state ranges and the
	// change-log receipt, so it can be called HERE too — analysis without asking
	// for the recording a second time.
	//
	// ## Why this sits ABOVE the classification gates (#2464 review round 2, S2)
	//
	// It used to sit BELOW `mutation === undefined`, which meant CALL ONE of every
	// unknown tool — the call the observational net exists for — was recorded by
	// the bridge and then returned unanalysed: `runPipeline` was never reached, so
	// the file was fixed and formatted by the `agent_settled` drain but never
	// linted, and AC2 ("an observed mutation gets its pipeline analysis in the
	// same turn") was met on the second call only. `observedReplayed > 0` is the
	// whole condition now: the bridge recorded this edit, whoever the tool is.
	if (observedReplayed > 0) {
		// ## The `hostToolResultFailed` asymmetry, stated rather than hidden
		//
		// The classified chain returns below on `event.isError === true` with a
		// `commitStatus: "failed"` receipt; this block does not consult it, so an
		// unknown tool that reports failure and STILL moved bytes is recorded,
		// analysed, and receipted as `committed`. That is deliberate: the
		// observation is disk evidence, not a claim — the bytes changed whatever
		// the tool says about itself — and the classified early return is safe
		// only because a failed host edit did not write. Reading a third-party
		// tool's self-reported status as authority over what is on disk is the
		// exact gap the observational net exists to close.
		//
		// The gates below (`mutation === undefined` / `!filePath` /
		// `isExternalOrVendorFile`) are deliberately NOT consulted for the SKIP:
		// once the bridge has recorded the edit, re-running the classified chain
		// double-records it regardless of how the tool classifies. They are
