 * The SAME file reaches this module under DIFFERENT path forms in one session:
 * forward-slash (`C:/…/x.ts`) from the LSP client + cascade fold via
 * `normalizeFilePath`, and backslash (`C:\…\x.ts`) from mode=full's reconcile
 * writing `result.filePath` and from `path.resolve`/event inputs on Windows.
 * Keyed raw, those coexisted as two entries: `mode=full` re-keyed on read and
 * the clean entry hid the stale one, but `mode=all`'s `formatAllMode` reads the
 * summaries verbatim and rendered the stale `blocking:1` as a 🔴 (#1020) — a
 * resolved state that replayed as still-broken on every `mode=all`.
 *
 * `normalizeEphemeralMapKey` (slash-fold + win32-lowercase, NO filesystem I/O)
 * is chosen over `normalizeMapKey`/`normalizeFilePath`, which call
 * `realpathSync.native()` — real disk I/O on EVERY diagnostic/runner/formatter
 * write, far too heavy for this hot path. The key only needs to be a stable
 * syntactic fold that collapses `\`↔`/` and Windows drive-letter case, which
 * this does; on-disk canonical casing is irrelevant for merely deduplicating a
 * process-local footer cache. The human-readable path is preserved separately
 * on the record's `filePath` (see `toDisplayPath`) for rendering/summaries.

	 * Lifetime — a retained row is retired by, and ONLY by:

	 *    carrying an {@link WidgetDiagnostic.anchorSpan} is NOT gated on the
	 *    file's mtime: `reconcileStaleWidgetFiles` asks the anchor instead — the
	 *    row stands while the marked LINE is still somewhere in the file, and
	 *    goes when it is not. Before #3183 this rule was the per-entry
	 *    `mtimeMs > observedAt` gate, which is FILE-scoped where the mark is
	 *    SPAN-scoped: ANY edit retired the row, including one that left the
	 *    marked line byte-identical, and nothing re-created it (later scans
	 *    filter the finding out and `reconcileWidgetDisposition` bails on an
	 *    absent record) — so the chip counted a mark until the file's next edit
	 *    rather than for as long as the mark stood. A row with no span — a
	 *    WEAK-anchored `suppress` mark, which is intent-level and has no line to
	 *    hash, or a row persisted by a pre-#3183 build — keeps the mtime gate
	 *    exactly as before, so neither gains an axis with no content-bound
	 *    retirement at all. Deletion of the file still drops the whole record;
	 * 2. a later scan reporting the same finding again — the incoming entry
	 *    matches by {@link retentionIdentity} and wins, so a row is never both
	 *    retained and live;
	 * 3. its mark ceasing to suppress it. `reconcileWidgetDisposition` drops a
	 *    row carrying this flag rather than re-arming it as a live finding the
	 *    last scan did not report;
	 * 4. {@link MAX_RETAINED_SUPPRESSED_PER_FILE}, the per-file bound on this
	 *    axis — the one axis that can hold rows no live scan reports.
	 *
	 * A retained row is never blocking: `isBlocking` answers `false` for any
	 * `disposition`, so it cannot draw a footer ● row, cannot be hoisted past a
	 * live finding by `capStoredDiagnostics`, and cannot enter the turn-end
	 * blocker sweep (#3158 round 2 F1). It is not a live finding either:
	 * `getFileDiagnosticSummaries` stops projecting every `disposition` row
	 * (#3183), so `mode=all`'s weak-fallback branch — reached exactly when the
	 * file's mtime moved past the observation, and unable to match a STRICT
	 * `false-positive` anchor — can never serve one as live.
	 *
	 * NOT stripped on session restore, unlike `stale`/`footerRetired`: those are
	 * verdicts about one session's disk state, whereas every retirement rule
	 * above outlives a resume — the mark is durable (the `.pi-lens` disposition
	 * store) and the anchor span is content-bound, so a restored row is

 * line down — `clients/pipeline.ts`'s per-edit `recordDiagnostics`, or
 * `reconcileCascadeNeighborLspErrors`, neither of which runs
 * `reconcileStaleWidgetFiles` — left the retained row standing beside the live
 * one, so a single finding was counted live AND in `suppressed: N`.

 * UNMARKED one matched the marked row and replaced it — the chip lost a mark
 * that was still applying. A collision is therefore resolved by the second half
 * of {@link WidgetDiagnostic.anchorSpan}'s contract, in `retainSuppressedRows`:

 * path and the bus-publish/mark-tool read accessors, all of which fire far
 * more often than an agent's own edit/tool cadence. Triggering a document
 * resync from every one of those reads would storm the LSP with didOpen calls
 * for a file whose drift hasn't yet been fixed. `tools/lens-diagnostics.ts`'s
 * `formatAllMode` — an explicit, agent-invoked tool call — is the resync
 * trigger point (#1641 criterion 2); this gate still demotes/logs on its own.
 *
 * The gate RE-DERIVES every entry's `stale` flag on every call — it is never
 * a one-way latch. A transient shrink that later restores (truncate-then-
 * write, a formatter pass, a checkout) un-demotes on its own next read, so
