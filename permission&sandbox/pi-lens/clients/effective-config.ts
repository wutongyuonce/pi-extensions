/**
 * Effective-config introspection (#2427; the introspection addition to #2415).
 *
 * ONE query answers "why is X running / selected", which today costs log
 * forensics across `lsp/config.ts`, `language-policy.ts` and the trust state.
 * `LSPService.getCapabilitySnapshots` is the proven template: compute the
 * answer once in the engine, project it through every adapter unchanged.
 *
 * Three rules this module is built on, and none of them is negotiable at a
 * call site:
 *
 * 1. IT DECIDES NOTHING. Every answer is read back from the same production
 *    machinery the runtime uses — `resolvePiLensConfig` for the resolution,
 *    `explainServersForFile` for the LSP gates, `detectFileKind` +
 *    `getToolPlan` + `getAvailableRunners` for dispatch. A second evaluation
 *    that agreed with production today would disagree with it eventually, and
 *    an introspection surface that lies is worse than none.
 * 2. IT REPORTS NOTHING. `resolveConfig` is pure and `reportPiLensConfigRecords`
 *    is a separate, explicit step (`config-core/index.ts`) precisely so a
 *    caller decides when a user gets warned. Asking "what is my config" must
 *    not emit a deprecation notice, and must not consume the warn-once latch
 *    that the loader needs — so this module carries record CODES and counts,
 *    and never calls the reporter.
 * 3. THE REDACTED VIEW IS THE ONLY VIEW. There is no `redact: false`. Config
 *    file paths are rewritten home-relative, a custom server's argv is cut to
 *    `argv[0]`, and its environment is reduced to NAMES — the two places a
 *    secret actually lives (#2415 AC 4). The `redact` option exists only
 *    because the issue named it; it is `true` or absent, and both mean the
 *    same thing, so no future caller can spell an unredacted request.

/**
 * The resolved model of pi-lens's configuration, with the provenance of every
 * decision — and, for one file, which servers and tools that configuration
 * selects or denies and why.
 *
 * ASKING CHANGES NOTHING (#2427 review round 3). The per-file half needs a
 * workspace's registered LSP config — `getConfigForFile` answers EMPTY for a
 * tree nothing initialized, which would report every server as selected — and
 * round 2 got it by calling `initLSPConfig(cwd, { report: false })`. That
 * inverted this surface's own guarantee: `initLSPConfig` is the session-root
 * registry's single writer and the per-root config store's only producer, so
 * a question about a foreign directory enrolled it as a served LSP root
 * (widening the #2052 access gate) and, after ~40 such questions, evicted a
 * live root's config from what was then a separate 32-entry LRU — silently
 * lifting the operator's `disabledServers` denial, which is precisely what
 * this surface promises cannot happen, and `shouldInitializeSessionRoot` never
 * repaired it because the 128-entry registry still reported the root served.
 * #2518 collapsed those two containers into one entry per root, so the second
 * half of that failure is gone; the first half — a read-only query enrolling a
 * foreign root at all — is still this surface's own to avoid
 *
 * So the query DERIVES the config instead: `lspConfigOf` (the projection
 * `loadLSPConfig` returns, minus the notices — rule 2) through the same
 * `registerLSPConfig` conversion, handed to `explainServersForFile` as an
 * explicit argument. Same gate, same answer, no write.
 *
 * ONE RESOLUTION ANSWERS THE WHOLE QUERY (#2427 review round 5, F-R4-1), taken
 * at the FILE's own directory whenever a file is asked about — matching what
 * the runtime registers via `ensureLSPConfigInitialized(path.dirname(filePath))`,
 * because a nested `repo/sub/.pi-lens.json` layer (config.ts header point 3)
 * reaches the runtime's decision no other way (round 4, F1).
 *
 * Round 4 moved the GATES to that root and left the rest — the redacted spec,
 * every `decidedBy`, the `documents` list — reading a SECOND resolution taken
 * at the workspace root. Two roots, and they disagreed: the view named the
 * root's definition of a server the runtime spawns from the nested one,
 * attributed a nested denial to whichever tier denied first at the root, and
 * omitted the nested document. Deriving both halves from a single resolution
 * makes that class of disagreement unrepresentable rather than fixed.
 *
 * The file-directory root is a SUPERSET of the workspace's ONLY when `file`
 * resolves inside `cwd` — the project walk runs upward and is
 * ceiling-bounded, so a nested `file` naturally passes back through the
 * workspace's own document on its way up. A `file` outside `cwd` has no such
 * relationship: its own ancestry can omit the workspace's document entirely
 * while `cwd` above still names the workspace, mislabelling a foreign tree's
 * config as this workspace's own (#2520). So the containment is CONFINED, not
 * assumed: a `file` that does not resolve inside `cwd` is rejected — with
 * `file: { error }` naming the `cwd` it was measured against and the remedy
 * (re-query with `cwd` set to the file's own workspace) — rather than
 * answered from an unrelated root. This confinement is a trade the query
 * makes deliberately, not a limitation to route around: it also rejects a
 * SIBLING package in the SAME monorepo (`cwd` at `repo/packages/a`, `file`
 * under `repo/packages/b`) even though both share a repo root, because the
 * per-file half is only ever correct when it is a superset of the workspace
 * half — a caller who wants package `b`'s answer queries with `cwd` set to
 * `repo/packages/b`. When no `file` is asked about, or the confined one is
 * used, the root IS (or nests under) the workspace `cwd`, and the fileless
 * case is the view `pilens_health` takes on every call.
 *
 * The differentials are pinned in `tests/clients/effective-config.test.ts`.
