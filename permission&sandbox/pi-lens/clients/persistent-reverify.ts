/**
 * #3170 — the bounded persistent-reverify pass.
 *
 * A finding whose own file is unchanged is re-delivered turn after turn from
 * the persisted actionable-warnings report without ever being re-observed
 * against the live server: the in-band publish carries forward DEFERRED-origin
 * file entries while their file has not moved
 * (`mergeActionableWarningsReports`'s scope guard), and the delta freshness
 * gate passes them because the file's mtime has not moved either. When the
 * root cause was fixed in a DIFFERENT file, the carried finding is stale in
 * fact but fresh by every on-disk axis.
 *
 * This module re-observes those files at turn_end, BEFORE the advisory
 * assembles, and the replacement entries fold into the turn's SINGLE in-band
 * publish (#3176 F1: a separate replacement publish spends the carry marker
 * and the main publish then drops the entries at the scope guard — the
 * blocker the review caught).
 *
 * Review-round contracts (#3176):
 * - **F2**: the fresh observation converts through the PRODUCER's own
 *   pipeline (`enrichFileFromLsp` — severity-2, code-action enrichment,
 *   fixable-only, the per-file caps), fed the touch's collected diagnostics
 *   as the cached arm so no second pull happens. No re-implementation.
 * - **F3**: an empty result is clean ONLY when the touch itself answers
 *   `confirmation: "confirmed"` — the silent-on-clean rule (#240/#533/#1253).
 *   A bare `{diags: []}` (the house double's silent empty, a tier-3 server
 *   still analyzing, a `skipReason`) is UNCONFIRMED: the carried warnings are
 *   kept verbatim and the render labels the gap. `touched.inconclusive` is
 *   `resolveTouchVerdict`'s output computed service-side and is honored
 *   directly.
 * - **F4**: every await is bound-wrapped (`bounded()`); `maxClientWaitMs` is
 *   only the spawn/ready budget, not a request ceiling.
 * - **F6**: no skip guard — every deferred-origin entry re-verifies each
 *   turn (re-arm), per the issue's failure table.
 *
 * Bounds: at most {@link MAX_REVERIFY_FILES} files per turn_end, a wall
 * budget of {@link REVERIFY_BUDGET_MS}, the turn-end abort signal, and no
 * new durable state — candidates come from the persisted report itself,
 * which is what was delivered last turn.
