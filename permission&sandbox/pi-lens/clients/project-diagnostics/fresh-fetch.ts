/**
 * THE heavyweight-analyzer reader for `lens_diagnostics mode=full` (#585).
 *
 * It superseded a cache-ONLY reader (`extractCachedProjectDiagnostics`, since
 * removed from ./extractors.ts as a #585-class dead parallel path — see that
 * file's header). That reader was deliberately cache-only because historically
 * mode=full had no safe way to trigger a scan itself: relaunching knip/jscpd/
 * gitleaks/govulncheck/opengrep/trivy/dead-code concurrently with the
 * session_start background pass over the SAME project root could double-spawn a
 * CPU-bound analyzer (the exact TUI-freeze/zombie-process pathology
 * `KnipClient.inFlight`'s docstring describes).
 *
 * That pathology is now closed for every one of these analyzers:
 * `KnipClient`, `JscpdClient`, and the `DeadCodeClient`s each carry their own
 * `inFlight` de-dupe map, and `GitleaksClient`/`GovulncheckClient`/
 * `TrivyClient`/`OpengrepClient` share `SecurityScanClient.dedupeScan` (landed
 * in #313, well before this issue — verified before writing this module). So
 * a mode=full opengrep run that races the session_start whole-tree scan of the
 * same root JOINS it rather than spawning a second (heavy) scan. So mode=full can
 * now safely trigger — or, via the de-dupe guard, *join* — a fresh run of
 * each analyzer instead of settling for a session_start-only snapshot that
 * can be hours stale in a long session.
 *
 * Mirrors the gating each analyzer already applies at session_start
 * (`clients/runtime-session.ts`) — same "not applicable to this project" /
 * "not installed" skip conditions — but never skips on a cache hit; it always
 * performs (or joins) an actual run. One deliberate exception: gitleaks (#608)
 * uses a looser "smart-default" gate here (any tracked git repo) than
 * session_start's strict opt-in-config gate, since mode=full is an
 * explicitly-requested comprehensive review and gitleaks is cheap/advisory —
 * see its own task below. Every fresh result is written back to
 * cache via the same `cacheManager.writeCache` session_start/turn_end use, so
 * a background pass racing in afterward reads a result at least as fresh as
 * its own.
 *
 * No extra write-ordering guard (`clients/write-ordering-guard.ts`) is
 * layered on top of this: an overlapping call to the same analyzer for the
 * same root always resolves to the exact same in-flight promise (the de-dupe
 * guard above), so concurrent writers here are always writing IDENTICAL
 * data — there is no "stale write lands after a fresher one" race to guard
 * against. A guard would only earn its keep if two *different* result
 * objects for the same key could race; that can't happen while every caller
 * for a given root shares one in-flight run.
 *
 * Does NOT change session_start's or turn_end's own scheduling (both remain
 * skip-if-cached) — this module is additive and mode=full-only.
 *
 * Abort handling: `formatFullMode` (`tools/lens-diagnostics.ts`) already
 * threads a combined signal (Escape/turn-abort OR'd with a hard wall-clock
 * ceiling, `FULL_SCAN_WALL_CLOCK_MS`) into the LSP sweep and the cheap
 * project-runner scan — this module accepts the SAME signal so a `mode=full`
 * abort also bounds the fresh-fetch instead of letting it run uncancelled for
 * up to trivy's own ~180s ceiling after the rest of the scan already stopped.
 * None of the six analyzer clients accept a cancellation token today (checked
 * each `analyze()`/`scan()` signature before assuming otherwise — none does),
 * so true in-flight cancellation isn't available at the client level. Instead
 * this races the overall `Promise.all(tasks)` against the abort signal and
 * returns whatever has already settled — the same "partial is OK, a hang is
 * not" shape `clients/deadline-utils.ts`'s `withDeadline(..., onTimeout:
 * "undefined")` and `clients/lsp/index.ts`'s `runWorkspaceDiagnostics` already
 * use. Already-spawned analyzer processes are NOT killed: they keep running in
 * the background (bounded by their own `SCAN_TIMEOUT_MS`/`ANALYSIS_TIMEOUT_MS`)
 * and still write their result to cache when they finish, so nothing already
 * in flight is wasted — the NEXT caller (or a background session_start/
 * turn_end pass) benefits from it. Analyzers that hadn't settled yet when the
 * abort fired are reported in both `cold` (so they don't silently read as
 * "ran clean") and `abortedIds` (so a caller can render a more honest reason
 * than "not applicable").
 *
 * One analyzer does NOT follow the trigger-or-join shape above: `test-runner`
 * (#1004). Its "scan" is the per-edit turn_end test fire (`runtime-turn.ts`),
 * which only ever runs the targeted/cascade-aware test files touched by a
 * turn's edits — there is no whole-project run to trigger here, and forcing
 * one on every mode=full call would be exactly the double-spawn-a-heavy-
 * analyzer cost the de-dupe guards above exist to avoid. Its task is a plain
 * cache-read of the `"test-runner-findings"` key turn_end already wrote,
 * mirroring the pre-#585 `extractCachedProjectDiagnostics` registry's
 * "test-runner" row (cache-only, never triggers a run) rather than the
 * fresh-run pattern every other task here uses — see that task's own comment.
 *
 * Refs: #585, #313 (the SecurityScanClient de-dupe prerequisite), #1004
