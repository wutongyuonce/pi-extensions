 *   - `index.ts` — `pi.registerFlag` for the CLI surface (name, description,
 *     default), as a loop over this array.
 *   - `clients/lens-config.ts` — parsing the key out of `~/.pi-lens/config.json`
 *     AND resolving the precedence chain, both keyed by `configKey`.
 *   - `clients/project-lens-config.ts` — the closest-wins nested walk for the
 *     `scope: "project"` entries.
 *   - `tests/index-wiring.test.ts` — the registration contract, derived rather
 *     than restated.
 *
 * Every entry is settable BOTH ways: `--<name>` on the CLI and `configKey` in
 * `~/.pi-lens/config.json`. Adding a toggle means adding one entry here; there
