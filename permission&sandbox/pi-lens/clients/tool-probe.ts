/**
 * The tool-probe spawn seam (#2894).
 *
 * A sibling of `tool-cwd.ts`: that module owns where a child that READS A
 * PROJECT starts, this one owns the fact that a child which reads no project
 * starts nowhere in particular.
 *
 * It is a module of its own rather than another export on `safe-spawn.ts`
 * deliberately. Every availability test in this repo fakes the process
 * boundary with `vi.mock("clients/safe-spawn.js", … { safeSpawnAsync })`, and
 * a same-module helper would call the module's own unmocked binding — the
 * probe would spawn for real while the test believed it had the boundary. One
 * module hop keeps every existing double production-faithful.

 * Run a tool's own presence/version invocation — `<tool> --version`, `cl`,
 * `go version`, `which <pm>`, `Get-Module -ListAvailable …` — and hand back
 * the raw spawn result for the caller's availability policy to classify.
 *
 * ## The contract: a probe never gets a `cwd`
 *
 * A probe asks whether a binary exists and what it calls itself. The answer
 * does not depend on the directory the child starts in, so this seam passes
 * NONE — the child inherits the host's directory and nothing it reports is
 * read out of a project. That is why the sweep in
 * `tests/clients/dispatch/runners/runner-spawn-cwd-sweep.test.ts` admits ONE
 * cwd-less spawn here instead of the 23 it admitted before: every one of those
 * sites re-decided the same thing in its own words, and 23 sentences a
 * reviewer has to re-read one at a time is how an admission table stops being
 * auditable (#2872 round 3 shipped 127 rows carrying two canned sentences,
 * four of them false where they were read).
 *
 * `cwd` is STRIPPED rather than merely left out of {@link ProbeSpawnOptions}:
 * the type stops an object literal from carrying one, and the destructure
 * below removes one that arrived inside an already-typed options object a
 * caller widened or spread. Both halves are guarded — deleting the
 * destructure changes this call's text, which retires the sweep's admission
 * row, and `tests/clients/probe-and-root-spawn-cwd.test.ts` reds on the
 * smuggled cwd reaching the child. A probe that genuinely needs to
 * run somewhere — `mix credo --version` needs a mix project, `cargo clippy
 * --version` needs a package, `eslint --version` resolves a project-local
 * binary — must call `safeSpawnAsync` directly and be admitted by that sweep
 * on its own reason.
