// their eviction records into one: runtime-session's session-start
// review-graph walk — which runs before any dispatch and floods a store with
// every file in the project — consumed the once-per-session ledger slot, and
// the dispatch store's OWN eviction (the one that actually risks a live
// read-back mid-dispatch) never got its own record. The reporter now carries
// the evicting store's `subject`, so `recordDegradationOnce`'s own

//
// #2243 item 2: a dispatch pins its file at start (`clearFileFactsFor`) and
// releases it at completion (`endDispatchFor`, in the dispatch's finally). The
// pin set therefore tracks dispatches actually IN FLIGHT, not the last N files
// touched.

// #2282: `sessionFacts` below is a flat `Map<factId, value>` shared by two
// unrelated fact shapes — a small FIXED vocabulary (tool availability keyed by
// command, the singleton "session.reviewGraph") and PER-FILE families that
// mint one key per file touched (session baseline, cascade baseline, review-
// graph entity snapshots) and never shrink. Only the second shape grows with
// batch size, so only it gets a bound; the fixed vocabulary stays on the plain
// map, unbounded, because its cardinality is small and stable. Per-file
// session facts opt into `boundedSessionFacts` instead, reusing fileFacts'
// LRU-count-cap-and-report discipline rather than adding a third mechanism.
// No pin exemption here (unlike fileFacts): every current per-file session
// fact is read once near dispatch start and written once at dispatch end, so
// nothing re-reads its OWN key later in the same dispatch the way a runner
// re-reads `file.content` — an eviction mid-batch only means the next dispatch
// of that path sees no previous baseline, the same safe state as its first
// ever dispatch this session.
//
// That equivalence holds only where an absent baseline means "report
// everything", which is true for the diagnostic baselines and false for the
// review-graph entity snapshot: there, an absent snapshot read as an empty one
// puts every symbol in `added` and drives a blast-radius run for a file that
// did not change. So an eviction leaves a tombstone, and a reader that needs
// the distinction asks `wasBoundedSessionFactEvicted`. Tombstones are keys
// only, and carry the same cap, so the coldest of them fall off in turn and
// that key reverts to first-dispatch semantics.
