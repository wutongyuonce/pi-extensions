/**
 * The ONE filter stack a findings surface applies before a diagnostic reaches
 * the agent: inline `pi-lens-ignore` comments (#442), stored dispositions
 * (#690 — false-positive/suppress/defer), and the project's `.pi-lens.json`
 * `rules.<id>.disable`/`select` policy, in that order.
 *
 * The order is load-bearing and is the one the per-edit dispatcher established:
 * inline suppression first (the user's in-file intent), then the stored marks,
 * then the project policy — so the policy filter sees the same set the per-edit
 * path produces, with no double counting and no policy-rejected leftovers.
 *
 * #3088: these were three separate calls open-coded in `lens-diagnostics.ts`'s
 * `mode=full` merge and nothing at all on the `lens_diagnostics source=lsp` /
 * `lsp_diagnostics` probe lane — so a finding an agent had marked
 * `false-positive` was hidden in `mode=delta`/`mode=full` and re-reported on
 * the lane `skills/pi-lens-lsp-navigation` steers agents to as PRIMARY. Both
 * lanes call this module now: `applyFindingPolicy` for surfaces that already
 * hold dispatch `Diagnostic`s, `applyLspFindingPolicy` for the probe lane,
 * which holds raw `LSPDiagnostic`s.
