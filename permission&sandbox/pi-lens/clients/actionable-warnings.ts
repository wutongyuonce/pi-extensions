 * Both bounds on ONE LSP round trip (#2504 review round 2, F3), as AGENTS.md
 * requires of any async step in a sweep loop: a per-call timeout AND the abort
 * signal. Resolves `undefined` when either bound wins; the caller reads that
 * as "this file was not checked", never as "this file is clean".
 *
 * #2523 slice 2 folded this onto `bounded()`. It used to be `withDeadline`
 * (deadline only) raced against a hand-built `abortRace` leg carried on the
 * deps — the fifth private spelling of "deadline AND signal".
 *
 * What the fold did NOT fix, stated because the first draft of this PR claimed
 * it did (#2557 review F5): the old shape did not silently degrade any wait.
 * Both construction sites derived the leg from the signal in the same
 * expression (`args.signal ? makeAbortRace(args.signal) : undefined`), so
 * `abortRace` was absent exactly when `signal` was, and the behaviour before
 * and after this fold is identical on that axis. What the fold actually buys
 * is that the two fields which had to AGREE are now one — a pairing invariant
 * that lived in prose is gone rather than enforced — plus the abandonment now
 * reaching the ledger, and the leg's listener now being released per call
 * instead of living as long as the loop's signal does.
 *
 * ## The loop's residual budget is a THIRD bound, and it must not reach the
 * ledger (#2557 review F-A)
 *
 * Round 1 clamped `bounded()`'s own timer to
 * `Math.min(pullTimeoutMs, remainingMs)`, so whenever the LOOP's own wall
 * budget was already low, `bounded()` armed at the shrunken value and — on
 * firing — recorded `hook-await-exceeded` naming THAT value as "the budget".
 * A healthy pull that simply started late in a big batch was reported as
 * exceeding a budget that exists in no configuration (measured: 400 ms
 * pulls, 12 files, "exceeded 65ms budget after 77ms"), and because
 * `recordDegradationOnce` is rising-edge, that benign row could silence a
 * genuinely wedged server later in the same session.
 *
 * `bounded()`'s OWN timer is now always armed at the full `pullTimeoutMs`, so
 * it only ever fires — and only ever records — when a call outlives its own
 * configured per-trip budget (`metadata.budgetMs === pullTimeoutMs`, always).
 * The loop's shrinking residual is enforced SEPARATELY, by racing `bounded()`
 * against `withDeadline(…, { onTimeout: "undefined" })` keyed to the loop's
 * own `deadlineAt` — a deadline-only wait with no ledger connection of its
 * own, the same primitive `bounded()` itself is built to replace when a
 * caller needs BOTH bounds. The still-running `bounded()` call is not
 * cancelled (nothing here can cancel already-started work); if it later
 * genuinely outlives `pullTimeoutMs`, it still records, correctly, on its own
 * clock.

 *
 * #2504 review round 5 (F1) generalized it to BOTH publishers, because the
 * in-band write was still blind and erased a deferred merge that landed
 * mid-turn. The two directions are asymmetric and the asymmetry is the whole
 * design:
 *
 *  - A DEFERRED publish carries the OLDER observation. Everything persisted is
 *    newer and is kept unconditionally; the deferred entries upsert into it
 *    wherever their file has not moved.
 *  - An IN-BAND publish carries the NEWER observation. It is this turn's own
 *    report, and its identity (turnIndex, projectSeq window, deltaOnly) is
 *    published untouched. From the persisted report it carries forward ONLY
 *    entries a deferral produced -- the scope guard, see
 *    {@link ActionableWarningsReportFile.origin}. Carrying everything would
 *    accumulate every prior turn's findings into a report whose scope field
 *    says "turn_delta"; carrying nothing is the F1 defect.
 *
 * Where both halves hold a file the warnings are UNIONED through mergeWarnings
 * (the same de-duplicating merge the dispatch/LSP union already uses), so a
 * newer entry is never REPLACED by an older one -- it only gains what the
 * older one found -- and the merged entry is aged by the OLDER of the two
 * stamps, because it now holds both observations.
 *
 * Exported because the merge, not the write, is what has to be pinned: a test
 * can hand it two reports and read the ordering decision directly.

 * The turn-end advisory for this report.

 * hardcoded `.pi-lens/cache/actionable-warnings.json` — correct only for a
 * project that already had a legacy `.pi-lens/` directory — so in every other
 * project the agent's `cat` of the advised path failed while the report sat
 * unread under `~/.pi-lens/projects/<slug>/cache/`. An OPTIONAL `cwd` would
 * have kept that bug alive behind a default, so callers must pass it.
