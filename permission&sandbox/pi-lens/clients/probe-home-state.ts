/**
 * The #2506 probe-home redirect, whole: the decision, the per-process memo it
 * is cached in, and the degradation event that decision produced.
 *
 * WHAT IT DECIDES. An ad-hoc probe against the BUILT `clients/*.js` — a bare
 * `node -e`, a throwaway `.mjs`, a harness script — has no `PI_LENS_HOME` pin,
 * so every logger and ledger it touches used to write into the maintainer's
 * REAL `~/.pi-lens`. Confirmed live on 2026-09-02: two review probes left 42
 * rows of `/p/.pi-lens.json` fixture garbage in real telemetry. When
 * `PI_LENS_HOME` is unset and the process looks like a probe — `PILENS_PROBE=1`,
 * a `cwd` inside a specific agent worktree, or a `cwd` under `os.tmpdir()` —
 * `resolveProbeHomeDir()` answers with a per-probe directory instead.
 *
 * WHY IT ALL LIVES HERE and not beside its `getGlobalPiLensDir()` sibling in
 * `file-utils.ts`, where round 2 of #2516 left it. `file-utils.ts` sits on an
 * import cycle (it still does, via `safe-spawn.js` -> `resource-sampler.js` ->
 * `instance-reaper.js` -> `file-utils.js`; the shorter route through
 * `degradation-ledger.js` -> `extension-log.js` was this move's doing —
 * `extension-log.ts` imported `file-utils.ts` for THIS function and nothing
 * else, so the edge went with it, and the known-violations baseline dropped
 * from 33 pinned cycles to 12 with none added). Fifteen log-family modules
 * call `getGlobalPiLensLogDir()` at their OWN module
 * top level. Under vitest's vite-SSR transform each import becomes a
 * `__vite_ssr_import_N__` variable assigned in source order, so one of those
 * top-level calls re-enters `file-utils.ts` while its body is only PARTWAY
 * through those assignments — and a resolver sitting there then dereferences a
 * binding that has not been assigned yet, throwing `ReferenceError: Cannot
 * access '__vite_ssr_import_N__' before initialization`. Measured live: the
 * re-entry arrives through `file-utils.ts`'s FIFTH import,
 * `spawn-timeout-cooldown.js`, so every binding declared from the sixth import
 * onward is unsafe on that path — which is most of the file.
 *
 * Round 2 of #2516 papered over that with an `isTestMode()` early return placed
 * ahead of the first unsafe dereference. That was load-order luck, not a
 * design: moving `file-utils.ts`'s own `isTestMode` import from fifth to last
 * makes the GUARD LINE ITSELF throw the same error. It also DEFEATED the
 * redirect for every process that has `VITEST` set but no `PI_LENS_HOME` pin —
 * vitest's own globalSetup/child processes — sending their logs to the real
 * home: the exact hermeticity hole the redirect exists to close.
 *
 * THIS module is off that cycle. It imports only node builtins and
 * `path-utils.js`, itself a leaf (node builtins plus the vendored, zero-import
 * `deps/minimatch.js`). A module off every cycle is fully evaluated before any
 * importer's body runs — in plain ESM and under the vite-SSR transform alike —
 * so none of its own bindings can ever be observed uninitialized, wherever an
 * importer chooses to place the import. That is what makes the guard
 * unnecessary rather than merely well-placed, and it is why module-scope
 * `const`s (including the `Symbol.for` below) are ordinary here where they were
 * a hazard in `file-utils.ts`.
 *
 * `tests/config/global-dir-probe-redirect.test.ts` pins the behaviour through
 * real spawned `node` children, including the VITEST-set-but-unpinned case.

/**
 * Where pi-lens writes its LOGS, ledger rows and debug dumps: `~/.pi-lens/` by
 * default, exactly like `getGlobalPiLensDir()` in `file-utils.ts` — but
 * redirected to a per-probe directory when this process looks like an ad-hoc
 * probe rather than a real pi session (#2506).
 *
 * Every log-family writer routes here: `latency.log`, `extension.log`,
 * `sessionstart.log`, `cascade.log`, `read-guard.log`, `tree-sitter.log`,
 * `word-index.log`, `bus-events.log`, `dispositions.log`, `dead-code.log`,
 * `ast-grep-tools.log`, `actionable-warnings.log`, `review-graph.log`, the
 * `logs/*.jsonl` diagnostic dir, the debug handle/heap dumps,
 * `log-cleanup.ts`'s sweep over all of the above, and `smells-rollup.ts`'s
 * read-side tail of `latency.log`/`bus-events.log` (a reader, but it must
 * follow the same root or it tails a file nobody is writing).
 *
 * WHY IT LIVES IN THIS MODULE and not next to its `getGlobalPiLensDir()`
 * sibling in `file-utils.ts` — see this file's header. Fifteen of the writers
 * listed above call this function at their OWN module top level, and
 * `file-utils.ts` is on an import cycle, so resolving from there could observe
 * `file-utils.ts` mid-initialization. Resolving from a module off every cycle
 * cannot.
 *
 * `PI_LENS_HOME` wins over any redirect, which is how
 * `tests/support/vitest-setup.ts` keeps test workers hermetic. Note the
 * redirect still applies under vitest for processes that setup does not cover
 * (globalSetup, and children spawned without the pin): #2516 round 2's
 * `isTestMode()` guard sent exactly those to the developer's real home.
 *
 * Deliberately does NOT write a line to the terminal when it fires. #1333 gives
 * pi sole ownership of the TTY, and
 * `tests/clients/extension-terminal-silence.test.ts` enforces that nothing
 * under `clients/` calls `process.std*.write` or `console.*` (round 2 of
 * #2506 shipped a `process.stderr.write` here and was red in CI for exactly
 * that). Nor can it log through `extension-log.ts`'s
 * `createSubsystemLogger`: that module imports THIS one, so an import back
 * the other way would close a new, unpinned `no-client-cycles` cycle — and
 * `extension.log` is itself redirected by this very function, so the line
 * would land in the probe home nobody reads. The durable signal is the
 * `global-dir-probe-redirect` degradation row instead, folded into
 * `getDegradationSummary()` at read time via
 * `getProbeHomeRedirectEvent()` above.
