	 * `safeSpawnAsync` the dispatch root, so `RUNNERS.go.args` built
	 * `./tools/tapctl/internal/lightning` relative to a root module that does
	 * not own that package. Marker discovery, the `.git` fallback, the

	 * log line and the bounded `tool-cwd-resolution` degradation now all come
	 * from the seam, with the runner's own table as the markers.
	 *
	 * This is a SECOND value, never a reassignment of `cwd`: the failed-target
	 * ledger (`recordResult` → `getFailedTargets`, read back by
	 * `getTestRunTarget`) is keyed by the DISPATCH root, and re-keying it per
	 * module would make a recorded failure unfindable from the turn that

	 *
	 * Review round 2, F6: there is deliberately NO clamp on a resolution that
	 * lands outside the dispatch root. The seam only answers outside it when
	 * the FILE is outside it (`tool-cwd.ts`: every in-tree branch is
	 * `isUnderDir`-checked), and the one production caller —
	 * `runtime-turn.ts`'s turn-end batch, on both the fresh and the deferred
	 * path — filters every target through `isExcludedTestTarget`, which fails
	 * CLOSED out of tree (#2522). Round 1 shipped that clamp plus a
	 * `tool-cwd-resolution` ledger row for it; neither could fire in a live
	 * session, so the row was a record nothing could observe and the guard was
	 * defence against a caller that does not exist. Both are gone. If a second

	 * per-suite `startTime`/`endTime` and drops it — measured absent from both
	 * vitest 4.1.10 and jest 30.4.2 output, so reading it would have left this
	 * at 0. The per-suite epoch pair is what both reporters actually emit.
	 *
	 * Wall-clock SPAN across suites (max end - min start), not a sum: suites in

	 * more elapsed time than the run took. With the single suite pi-lens
	 * actually produces (one test file per invocation) the two agree.
	 *
	 * The span excludes the runner's own startup: the top-level `startTime` is
	 * ~330ms earlier than the first suite's on this repo. What the per-suite
	 * pair then measures is NOT the same quantity across runners. On vitest it
	 * tracks test time closely (135ms span against 134ms of summed assertions),
	 * but jest stamps a suite's `startTime` before transform and module load,
	 * so the same fields give 5595ms against 128ms of assertions. Both are
	 * honest suite wall clock; neither is comparable to the other, and only the
	 * vitest figure is close to what pytest's `in 0.05s` or ExUnit's
	 * `Finished in 0.05 seconds` report.
	 *
	 * Falls back to the summed per-assertion `duration` when a reporter omits
	 * the suite pair. Never returns a negative or non-finite value — a garbled
	 * payload must degrade to "unmeasured", not to a wrong number.
	 *
	 * #1479: that degradation is now literal. This used to return 0 for a
	 * payload it could not read, which is the figure a sub-millisecond suite
	 * also produces, so the caller could not tell them apart. It returns

	// --- Generic text parser for non-JSON runners ---

	/**
	 * #1480: elapsed time for the runners `parseGenericRunnerOutput` handles.
	 *
	 * Before this, only go's `ok  pkg  0.25s` was read and every other runner
	 * reported a hardcoded 0. #1479 made the log tell "measured" from
	 * "unmeasured", but this parser is the `default:` arm behind cargo, dotnet,
	 * maven, gradle, rspec, minitest and every unrecognised runner, so all of
	 * them still reported a number nobody measured. Each runner below prints
	 * its elapsed time in the same summary block this parser already regexes
	 * for pass/fail counts.
	 *
	 * Absent, not 0, is the answer when nothing is found — see
	 * `TestResult.duration` and `run-duration.ts`. A probe that returned 0 here
	 * would be claiming a measurement.
	 *
	 * One parser serves all runners, so the probe is selected BY RUNNER NAME.
	 * Running every probe over every runner's output was the original shape of
	 * this code, and it let gradle borrow a number: `BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 3s`
	 * plus a preceding `... ok` line satisfied go's `ok <pkg> <n>s` probe, so
	 * the whole-build wall clock got reported as test time — the exact wrong
	 * number this function refuses to print. Gating on the runner makes that
	 * structurally impossible rather than merely unlikely, and it matters most
	 * for the `default:` arm of the switch, which is where an unrecognised or
	 * custom runner's arbitrary output lands.
	 *
	 * Within a runner the patterns are still anchored where an anchor helps,
	 * for the same reason #1452's PHPUnit `Time:` pattern is anchored: an
	 * unanchored /m match takes the FIRST hit over stdout+stderr, and a failure
	 * diff quoting "Finished in ..." would beat the real summary. Note what the
	 * `^` in `^Finished in` does and does not buy. It rejects a decoy that is
	 * INDENTED, which is what a quoted expectation or an assertion diff is; it
	 * does NOT rank two column-0 matches, so an unindented decoy printed by the
	 * suite itself would still win. It is a cheap filter for the common shape,
	 * not a proof of uniqueness. And it is not an anchor to the counts line for
	 * rspec or minitest: both print their elapsed time on a `Finished in ...`
	 * line and their counts (`3 examples, 0 failures`, `1 runs, 1 assertions,
	 * ...`) on a different line.
	 *
	 * KNOWN LIMIT — first summary only. cargo across multiple crates, `dotnet
	 * test` across multiple assemblies, and `go test ./...` across multiple
	 * packages each print one summary per unit, and these probes take the
	 * first. A multi-unit run therefore UNDER-REPORTS its duration. That is
	 * left as-is deliberately: the count parsers below have the same first-match
	 * shape for those runners, so duration and counts describe the same scope.
	 * Fixing one without the other would trade an under-report for an
	 * inconsistency. Pinned by test so it stays a known limit, not an accident.
	 *
	 * Formats and how each was verified:
	 *
	 * - go — `ok  example.com/pkg  0.253s`. Pre-existing pattern, unchanged
	 *   apart from the shared finite/non-negative guard.
	 *
	 * - cargo — `test result: ok. 3 passed; 0 failed; 1 ignored; 0 measured;
	 *   0 filtered out; finished in 0.253s`. NOT VERIFIED AGAINST A LIVE CARGO
	 *   RUN — this box has no MSVC linker, so `cargo test` cannot link. Format
	 *   read out of the libtest printer shipped with the local rustc 1.94.1:
	 *   `library/test/src/formatters/pretty.rs` builds `"; finished in
	 *   {exec_time}"` and `library/test/src/time.rs` renders `TestSuiteExecTime`
	 *   as `{:.2}s`. Older rustc omits the suffix entirely; that degrades to
	 *   unmeasured.
	 *
	 * - dotnet/vstest — `Failed: 1, Passed: 2, Skipped: 0, Total: 3, Duration:
	 *   1 m 30 s - t.dll (net8.0)`. NOT VERIFIED AGAINST A LIVE `dotnet test` —
	 *   NuGet restore has no network here. Format read out of the
	 *   vstest.console.dll shipped with the local .NET SDK 8.0.423, which holds
	 *   the literal `{0} - Failed: {1}, Passed: {2}, Skipped: {3}, Total: {4},
	 *   Duration: {5}` next to the unit literals `" h"`, `" m"`, `" s"`,
	 *   `" ms"`, `"< 1 ms"`. The duration is a space-joined token list, so it
	 *   is summed rather than read as one number.
	 *
	 * - maven/surefire — `Tests run: 4, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0,
	 *   Time elapsed: 0.05 s -- in com.example.AppTest`. NOT VERIFIED AGAINST A
	 *   LIVE MAVEN — no mvn on this box. Summed across the per-class lines,
	 *   because surefire prints `Time elapsed` per test class and its final
	 *   `Results:` total carries no time. `[INFO] Total time: 3.4 s` is
	 *   deliberately NOT used: that is whole-build wall clock including compile,
	 *   which would report a wrong number rather than none. Surefire 2.x wrote
	 *   `sec` where 3.x writes `s`; both are accepted.
	 *
	 *   EXPECT THIS TO BE ABSENT IN PRACTICE. pi-lens invokes `mvn test -q`
	 *   (see RUNNERS.maven above), and surefire logs its per-class `Tests run:
	 *   ..., Time elapsed: ...` lines at INFO, which `-q` suppresses. Only the
	 *   ERROR-level lines of a FAILING class survive, so a green maven run
	 *   typically reports unmeasured and a red one reports the failing classes'
	 *   time alone. REASONED, NOT RUN — there is no mvn on this box to confirm
	 *   it. Left in rather than dropped: it costs nothing, it is correct when
	 *   the output does carry the lines (a repo that sets `-Dsurefire.useFile`
	 *   or drops `-q` via `.mvn/maven.config`), and `unmeasured` is an honest
	 *   report of the quiet case.
	 *
	 * - rspec — `Finished in 0.32394 seconds (files took 0.49427 seconds to
	 *   load)`. VERIFIED against a live rspec-core 3.13.6 run on ruby 3.4.10.
	 *   The minutes form (`Finished in 2 minutes 15.14 seconds`) comes from
	 *   `RSpec::Core::Formatters::Helpers.format_duration` in the same
	 *   installed gem; rspec never prints hours. Load time trails the run time
	 *   on the same line and must not be read instead of it.
	 *
	 * - minitest — `Finished in 0.254594s, 7.8557 runs/s, 7.8557 assertions/s.`
	 *   VERIFIED against a live minitest 5.25.4 run on ruby 3.4.10. The format
	 *   string is `"Finished in %.6fs, ..."` in minitest.rb, always seconds.
	 *
	 * - gradle — deliberately left unmeasured, and now UNREACHABLE by any other
	 *   runner's probe rather than merely unmatched by it. Gradle's console
	 *   summary (`4 tests completed, 1 failed`) carries no elapsed time, and
	 *   `BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 3s` is whole-build wall clock including compile
	 *   and dependency resolution. Reporting that as test time would be a wrong
	 *   number; #1479 makes the absence legible in the log instead.
