/**
 * What pi-lens ALREADY tracks, and where an observed change is replayed to
 * (#2430).
 *
 * The observational net has to answer one question in three places — the
 * `tool_call` pre-snapshot, the `tool_result` diff, and the `agent_settled`
 * sweep — and the answer must be the same set every time, or a file drifts in
 * and out of coverage depending on which seam asked. This module is that single
 * source: the read-guard's read/write set, the widget's diagnostic files, and
 * the documents open on any live language server rooted at the workspace.
 *
 * There is deliberately NO workspace walk here. The whole point of #2430 item 3
 * is that the turn-boundary net costs a bounded number of stats over files
 * pi-lens has already seen; a walk would make the settle boundary pay for the
 * project's size on every run.
 *
 * The replay recorder is the mutation bridge. Nothing in this module writes
 * bookkeeping itself: an observed change goes through exactly the seam an
 * in-process producer uses, so the read-guard stamp, the `turn-state.json`
 * entry, the attributed change-log receipt and the deferred format at
 * `agent_settled` are the SAME code path a `write` takes.
