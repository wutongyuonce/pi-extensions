/**
 * The validate/normalize half of the config pipeline (#2425, scope item 1).
 *
 * `RawConfig` (whatever `JSON.parse` returned) -> `validate(schema)` ->
 * `NormalizedConfig` (only fields the schema claims, each of the declared
 * shape). `merge.ts` then combines normalized configs across tiers, so the
 * merger never has to ask whether a value is the type it looks like.
 *
 * Four rules, the first three from `docs/public-api-stability.md`:
 *
 * 1. NEVER THROW. A user's config file is untrusted input; a schema violation
 *    degrades that field to absent and records why. A throw here would take
 *    down a session over a typo.
 * 2. UNKNOWN FIELDS ARE DROPPED, NOT KEPT. pi-lens's default is closed, unlike
 *    JSON Schema's — a schema opts into openness with `additionalProperties`.
 *    Keeping unknown fields would make every typo a silently-ignored setting,
 *    which is the failure users actually report.
 * 3. EVERY DROP IS RECORDED, with a stable `PILENS_CFG_*` code and a reason
 *    built from structure alone. No value ever reaches a record.
 * 4. THE WALK NEVER STOPS EARLY, and a user subtree is never passed through.
 *    Every node the validator returns was BUILT here, key by key, out of values
 *    this module checked. There is no arm on which a caller's object becomes
 *    part of the result by assertion.
 *
 * Rule 4 is the #2440 review finding, and it is worth stating why the two
 * pass-through arms it replaces were wrong rather than merely untidy. A schema
 * node that declares no `type` used to hand its value straight to the domain
 * type with `as ConfigValue`. That single assertion cost three properties at
 * once: the subtree's keys never met the prototype-key policy, so a
 * `{"__proto__": {...}}` node reached `out[name] = …` in BOTH builders and
 * re-parented the accumulator (serializing as `{}` while answering the
 * attacker's value on every field read); the subtree's depth was never counted,
 * so `MAX_CONFIG_DEPTH` bounded only the paths the schema happened to describe
 * and a 4000-deep blob went to the merger intact and overflowed the stack there;
 * and no record was produced for anything inside it, so the drop the pipeline
 * promises to explain was invisible. An always-walking normalizer fixes all
 * three by construction, which is the reason it is one normalizer and not three
 * patches.
 *
 * An OPAQUE node is still walked OPEN, not closed: a schema that claims nothing
 * about a node keeps that node's children, exactly as the pass-through did. What
 * changes is that they are copied, depth-counted, key-checked, and recorded. A
 * node that DOES name properties keeps its own (closed-by-default) policy.
 *
 * The walk is bounded on both axes that can grow: depth (a hand-written config
 * can nest arbitrarily) and record count (`MigrationRecordCollector`). Objects
 * already visited on the current path are refused, so a caller that hands in a
 * cyclic value gets a record rather than a stack overflow.
