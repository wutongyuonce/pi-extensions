/**
 * The stability registry for pi-lens's PUBLIC config surfaces (#2418).
 *
 * At ~28k downloads/month a config field or a warning string becomes a
 * compatibility obligation the moment it ships. This module is the one place
 * that obligation is written down as DATA, so the policy in
 * `docs/public-api-stability.md` is enforceable by test rather than by
 * convention:
 *
 * - `STABILITY_TIERS` / `STABILITY_TIER_KEY` — the `x-stability` annotation
 *   every published schema property must carry. New fields default to
 *   `experimental`; only `stable` fields are covered by the compatibility
 *   guarantee. Promotion is a deliberate, changelogged act.
 * - `CONFIG_SCHEMA_ID` / `CONFIG_SCHEMA_ANCHOR_KEY` — the reserved schema
 *   identity anchor the unified config envelope carries from its first
 *   published version (#2416 populates it; nothing here emits config).
 * - `CONFIG_DIAGNOSTIC_CODES` — a closed, APPEND-ONLY namespace of stable
 *   codes for user-facing config validation and migration warnings, so a user
 *   can match or suppress on `PILENS_CFG_0001` instead of on prose. Message
 *   text may change freely; codes may never be renumbered or removed.
 * - `DEPRECATED_CONFIG_SURFACES` — the deprecation window (`deprecatedSince` /
 *   `removeNotBefore`) for every legacy config key and file location that is
 *   still read. Removal happens only in a major, through the documented
 *   breaking-change checklist.
 *
 * Deliberately DEPENDENCY-FREE: this is a data leaf imported by the config
 * loaders, the degradation ledger seam, and the governance tests. It must
 * never grow an import on a module that itself reports config diagnostics.
