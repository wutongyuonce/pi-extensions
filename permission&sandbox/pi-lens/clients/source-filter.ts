/**
 * Source File Filter — Deduplicates source files by detecting build artifacts.
 *
 * Problem: When scanning a codebase, we encounter both source files and their

 * Scanning both wastes time and produces duplicate findings.
 *
 * Solution: For each file, check if a "higher precedence" source sibling exists.
 * If yes, skip the file as a build artifact. If no, keep it as hand-written source.
 *
 * Supported ecosystems:
 * - TypeScript: .ts shadows .js, .tsx shadows .jsx
 * - Vue/Svelte: .vue/.svelte shadows .js
 * - CoffeeScript: .coffee shadows .js
 *
 * Files without higher-precedence siblings are kept only when they do not look
 * generated/codegen-produced (hand-written JS, Python, Go, Rust, etc.).

 * `fs.existsSync`. Enumerating a directory with many files of the same
 * basename family (e.g. `foo.js`, `foo.test.js`, `foo.spec.js` all probing for
 * `foo.ts`) or many files that all fail the same probe re-issues identical
 * `existsSync` calls.
 *
 * This cache is intentionally scoped to a single walk (created at the start of
 * one `collectSourceFiles`/`collectSourceFilesAsync` call and discarded when
 * it returns). A walk is a point-in-time filesystem snapshot, so caching
 * within it needs no invalidation by construction — there is no persistent,
 * module-global cache here, and none should be added: siblings can change
 * between walks, and a stale persistent cache risks silently misclassifying a
 * file (lost detection), which is exactly why issue #191 deferred a
 * persistent version. Callers that don't pass a cache get exactly today's
 * behavior (fail-safe default of "probe every time").
 *
 * Keyed via {@link normalizeEphemeralMapKey} — the cheap, syntactic-only
 * sibling of `normalizeMapKey` (no `realpathSync`) — so lookups are
 * separator/case-consistent on Windows without paying a filesystem round
 * trip just to compute the key. Using the full `normalizeMapKey` here would
 * be actively counterproductive: for a candidate sibling path that does not
 * exist (the common case), it resolves the nearest existing ancestor via its
 * own `existsSync` walk, which measured ~11x slower than the single
 * `existsSync` probe this cache exists to avoid (refs #191). This cache's
 * keys are produced by this process's own `path.join` calls within a single
