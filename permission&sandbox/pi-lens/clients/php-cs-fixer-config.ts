/**
 * php-cs-fixer ancestor config carriage (#2472).
 *
 * `php-cs-fixer`'s own `ConfigurationResolver` does NOT walk up parent
 * directories looking for a config file — verified against
 * `computeConfigFiles()` in `PHP-CS-Fixer/PHP-CS-Fixer` at tag `v3.64.0`
 * (commit `58dd9c931c785a79739310aef5178928305ffa67`,
 * `src/Console/ConfigurationResolver.php:548-588`). There is no `--path`
 * OPTION on `fix` — `path` is a positional `InputArgument` (the file(s) to
 * format; `--path-mode` only changes how an EXPLICIT `--config`'s own
 * `finder()` intersects with it, per `FixCommand.php:206-207`), and the
 * candidate directory is driven by that positional argument's dirname, not
 * by `$this->cwd` — cwd is only a SECOND, ADDITIONAL probe appended when it
 * differs from the path's directory:
 *
 *   $path = $this->getPath();
 *
 *   if ($this->isStdIn() || 0 === \count($path)) {
 *       $configDir = $this->cwd;
 *   } elseif (1 < \count($path)) {
 *       throw new InvalidConfigurationException('For multiple paths config parameter is required.');
 *   } elseif (!is_file($path[0])) {
 *       $configDir = $path[0];
 *   } else {
 *       $dirName = pathinfo($path[0], PATHINFO_DIRNAME);
 *       $configDir = is_dir($dirName) ? $dirName : $path[0];
 *   }
 *
 *   $candidates = [
 *       $configDir.\DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR.'.php-cs-fixer.php',
 *       $configDir.\DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR.'.php-cs-fixer.dist.php',
 *       $configDir.\DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR.'.php_cs', // old v2 config, present here only to throw nice error message later
 *       $configDir.\DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR.'.php_cs.dist', // old v2 config, present here only to throw nice error message later
 *   ];
 *
 *   if ($configDir !== $this->cwd) {
 *       $candidates[] = $this->cwd.\DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR.'.php-cs-fixer.php';
 *       $candidates[] = $this->cwd.\DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR.'.php-cs-fixer.dist.php';
 *       $candidates[] = $this->cwd.\DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR.'.php_cs'; // old v2 config, present here only to throw nice error message later
 *       $candidates[] = $this->cwd.\DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR.'.php_cs.dist'; // old v2 config, present here only to throw nice error message later
 *   }
 *
 *   return $candidates;
 *
 * We always spawn `fix` with the FILE as a positional argument (not stdin,
 * never a bare directory), so `$path[0]` is always that file and `$configDir`
 * always resolves to `pathinfo($path[0], PATHINFO_DIRNAME)` — the file's OWN
 * directory — REGARDLESS of the spawned process's cwd.
 *
 * #2472 review round 3, F3 correction: an EARLIER version of this comment
 * concluded from the above that "spawning with `cwd = <ancestor config's
 * directory>` would NOT work" and that `--config` is "the only carriage —
 * there is no spawn-option workaround." That conclusion does not follow from
 * the quoted code and is FALSE: the `$configDir !== $this->cwd` branch
 * appends `$this->cwd`-rooted candidates whenever the file's own directory
 * differs from the spawn's cwd — the common case, since we always spawn one
 * file below the project root. Spawning with `cwd` set to the ancestor
 * config's directory WOULD make `computeConfigFiles()` find it, via that
 * second branch. `--config <path>` remains the better fix regardless: it
 * names the exact winning file directly, with no reliance on this
 * inequality quirk (and no need to compute a spawn `cwd` distinct from the
 * file's own directory, which `formatFile` doesn't do) — it is the better
 * carriage, not the only possible one.
 *
 * Unlike prettier/biome/eslint, an ancestor config found by `detect()`'s own
 * climb (`hasPhpCsFixerConfig` in `clients/tool-policy.ts`,
 * `phpCsFixerFormatter.detect` in `clients/formatters.ts`) is invisible to a
 * bare `php-cs-fixer fix <file>` invocation whenever that ancestor directory
 * is neither the file's own directory nor the spawn's cwd — php-cs-fixer
 * silently falls back to its built-in default ruleset instead of the
 * project's configured one.
 *
 * `computeConfigFiles()`'s own candidate order also settles same-directory
 * precedence: `.php-cs-fixer.php` wins over `.php-cs-fixer.dist.php` when
 * both sit in the SAME directory (first match in the array wins). This
 * resolver mirrors that precedence; the two legacy v2 names are not one of
 * pi-lens's detection targets (`hasPhpCsFixerConfig`/
 * `phpCsFixerFormatter.detect` never look for them either) so they are not
 * candidates here.
 *
 * Reuses the shared `findLocalToolConfig` walker (`clients/path-utils.ts`) —
 * the same single source of truth `opengrep-config.ts`, `sgconfig.ts`,
 * `typos-config.ts`, and `zizmor-config.ts` already delegate to for their own
 * "walk up for one of these config filenames" search (refs #680, #2472
 * review F2), rather than a private walker of its own. Called with NO
 * `homeDir` — deliberately UNCEILINGED (#2472 review round 3, F1): this
 * resolver's own gates (`hasPhpCsFixerConfig` in `clients/tool-policy.ts`,
 * `phpCsFixerFormatter.detect` in `clients/formatters.ts`) are both
 * unceilinged too (`findNearestContaining`/`findUp` walk to the filesystem
 * root), so a ceilinged carriage here would disagree with its own gate — the
 * gate says "config exists" while the carriage says "not found", silently
 * dropping the `--config` argv this module exists to carry.
