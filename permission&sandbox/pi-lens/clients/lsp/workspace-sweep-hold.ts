/**
 * #1618: a full workspace sweep (`LSPService.runWorkspaceDiagnostics`, the
 * engine behind `lens_diagnostics mode=full`) grants itself a wall-clock
 * ceiling (`FULL_SCAN_WALL_CLOCK_MS`, see {@link getFullScanWallClockMs})
 * that can outlive the detached LSP idle-reset timer armed by
 * `clients/runtime-turn.ts`'s `handleTurnEnd` on a file-less turn. Nothing
 * previously stopped that timer from firing mid-sweep and destroying the
 * very service the sweep was actively touching — every file the sweep had
 * not yet reached then failed with zero trace and got mislabeled as budget
 * exhaustion.
 *
 * This module is the shared hold: `runWorkspaceDiagnostics` acquires it for
 * its own lifetime (try/finally, so a throw or an aborted sweep still
 * releases it) and the idle-reset timer consults it before firing. Holds are
 * tracked as TOKENS (acquire-time-stamped), not a bare counter — two
 * overlapping `lens_diagnostics mode=full` calls (or a sweep started while
 * another is still finishing) must each be free to release independently
 * without the other's hold being dropped early.
 *
 * A leaked hold that never re-arms idle reset is the inverse defect (state
 * that must re-arm cannot hide behind a stuck guard), so this module screens
 * against it on TWO axes, matching the repo's own session-boundary +
 * bounded-lifetime conventions:
 *   1. `clearWorkspaceSweepHoldForSessionStart` — `resetLSPService({reason:
 *      "session_start"})` clears every held token unconditionally. A session
 *      boundary means no in-flight sweep from a PRIOR generation is still
 *      meaningful to wait on.
 *   2. `reapStaleHolds` (internal, called from every liveness check) —
 *      force-releases any token older than {@link getWorkspaceSweepMaxHoldAgeMs},
 *      derived from the sweep's own wall-clock ceiling plus a safety margin.
 *      A real sweep is either done or self-aborted well within that window
 *      (`tools/lens-diagnostics.ts` races `FULL_SCAN_WALL_CLOCK_MS`), so a
 *      token still held past it can only be a bug — never a legitimate long
 *      sweep — and gets force-released with its own distinct log record.
 *
 * `getFullScanWallClockMs` also lives here (rather than duplicated between
 * `tools/lens-diagnostics.ts` and `clients/runtime-turn.ts`) so the idle-reset
 * delay on every path (base AND the subagent/budget-shortened paths) can be
 * DERIVED from the sweep's own ceiling instead of the constants drifting
 * apart again (#1618 acceptance criterion 6).
