/**
 * LSP Configuration for pi-lens
 *
 * Allows users to define custom LSP servers and override initialization options
 * for built-in servers via configuration.
 *
 * CANONICAL LOCATION (#2426): the `lsp` namespace of `.pi-lens.json` (project)
 * and `~/.pi-lens/config.json` (machine-global). `.pi-lens/lsp.json`,
 * `pi-lsp.json` and `~/.pi-lens/lsp.json` — and the four LSP keys at the ROOT
 * of a canonical file — are still read for their deprecation window
 * (`DEPRECATED_CONFIG_SURFACES`) and emit one migration warning per
 * `(file, key)` naming where the setting moves. The canonical spelling wins
 * every collision. `docs/configuration.md` documents the full lookup order;
 * discovery itself lives in `clients/config-resolve.ts`, which this module and
 * the other two loaders now share.
 *
 * Example — custom server (canonical spelling, inside `.pi-lens.json`):
 * {
 *   "lsp": {
 *     "servers": {
 *       "my-server": {
 *         "name": "My Custom LSP",
 *         "extensions": [".myext"],
 *         "command": "my-lsp-server",
 *         "args": ["--stdio"],
 *         "rootMarkers": ["package.json"]
 *       }
 *     }
 *   }
 * }
 *
 * Example — override initializationOptions for a built-in server:
 * {
 *   "lsp": {
 *     "serverOverrides": {
 *       "rust": {
 *         "initializationOptions": {
 *           "check": { "command": "clippy", "allTargets": true },
 *           "cargo": { "features": "all", "targetDir": true }
 *         }
 *       },
 *       "nix": {
 *         "initializationOptions": {
 *           "nixpkgs": { "expr": "import <nixpkgs> {}" }
 *         }
 *       }
 *     }
 *   }
 * }
 *
 * The `initializationOptions` object is deep-merged onto the server's built-in
 * defaults, so you only need to specify the keys you want to change or add.
 * User-supplied values win on conflicts at every level of nesting.
 *
 * Server IDs match the `id` field of each built-in server definition in
 * clients/lsp/server.ts (e.g. "rust", "nix", "bash", "python", "go", "ts").

/**
 * Load LSP configuration — a PROJECTION of the one resolved pi-lens config.
 *
 * Everything that used to be here (the candidate list, the unbounded upward
 * walk, the two-object merge with its four hand-patched keys) now lives in
 * `config-resolve.ts` and applies identically to the other two loaders. What is
 * left is the projection: pick the `lsp` section out of the resolved value and
 * shape it into `LSPConfig`.
 *
 * Three behaviors changed with the move, all of them deliberate and all of them
 * pinned by `tests/clients/config-golden-layouts.test.ts`:
 *
 * 1. THE WALK IS CEILING-BOUNDED. It used to run to the filesystem root with no
 *    `$HOME` stop, so a `pi-lsp.json` in the user's home directory was adopted
 *    by every project on the machine (#622/#625's class, and #2426's one
 *    outright bug fix rather than deprecation).
 * 2. THE CANONICAL FILE WINS. `.pi-lens.json` used to LOSE to a leftover
 *    `.pi-lens/lsp.json` in the same directory, which made the migration users
 *    are now being asked to perform impossible to complete.
 * 3. NESTED CONFIGS LAYER instead of the nearest one winning wholesale, which
 *    is the same nearest-wins-per-field rule `.pi-lens.json`'s `ignore` has had
 *    since #783.
 *
 * `homeDir` is a test seam only, matching `findNestedProjectMutationValue`'s.
 *
 * `report: false` performs the same resolution and returns the same config
 * WITHOUT firing a user-facing notice (#2427 review round 2, F6). It exists for
 * `effectiveConfig`, whose whole contract is that asking what your
 * configuration is must not warn you about it or consume the warn-once latch
 * that the session-start load needs. Suppressing means suppressing BOTH sinks —
 * the record report and the per-document read-failure report — because a
 * question that answers "your global config is unreadable" by emitting the
 * loader's own degradation notice has reported all the same.
 *
 * It lives HERE and only here. `initLSPConfig` used to take the same option so
 * that `effectiveConfig` could initialize a workspace quietly; round 3 removed
 * that call outright, which removed the option, the parallel "which run is
 * silent" set beside `configInFlight`, and the reporting-caller-never-joins-a-
 * silent-run rule the two of them needed.

/**
 * Write the session's ONE `config_resolved` record (#2526).
 *
 * Positive observability for the Phase 0 config stack: before this, a correct
 * canonical-only resolution proved itself only by the ABSENCE of
 * `PILENS_CFG_*` rows — the silent-success gap AGENTS.md warns about.
 *
 * REDACTED by construction, not by mode. Everything it can say comes from
 * `summarizeConfigResolution`, the same projection `pilens_effective_config`
 * embeds: document PATHS (home-relative), tiers, the legacy flag, per-tier
 * leaf counts, and a record COUNT. No config value, and no absolute `$HOME`,
 * can reach the log through it.
 *
 * NO SECOND RESOLUTION (#2513's facade rule): it reads the resolution its
 * caller already performed. And it adds no `await` — `logLatency` and
 * `logSessionStart` are synchronous buffered writers — so the session-start
 * hook path gains nothing to wait on (#2523).
 *
 * ONE row per session AND SERVED ROOT, claimed through the logger's own
 * session-scoped bookkeeping rather than a latch kept here. `loadLSPConfig` is
 * the funnel every config resolution goes through (`initLSPConfig` at session
 * start and at each served root, the MCP `ensureReady` boot,
 * `ensureLSPConfigInitialized` on the first edit), so an unconditional write
 * would emit one row per resolution and the per-session count the smell
 * analyzer joins on would be unrecoverable from the log.
 *
 * The ROOT is part of the claim (#2526 review round 2, F3). A warm MCP server
 * calls `ensureReady` per served root (`mcp/server.ts`), and a phase-only
 * claim recorded the FIRST root's documents and nothing else — project B's
 * legacy config document never reached a row, so the
 * "legacy-document-with-no-records" smell structurally could not fire for it.
 * `configResolutionKey` keys it (fold, canonicalize, fold — see below), the
 * repo-wide rule for every path-keyed map (#210): a `/`-vs-`\` spelling of
 * one root must not buy a second row.
 */
/**
 * THE (session, root) key of every config-resolution record: the
 * `config_resolution_pending` mark, the `config_resolved` row and claim, and
 * the release of that claim when the root is evicted.
 *
 * Fold separators, THEN canonicalize, then fold again — in that order, and
 * neither step alone is enough (#2518 review F6). `normalizeFilePath` folds
 * separators and Windows casing but is the IDENTITY on a POSIX path that
 * merely needs canonicalizing, so `"/proj/"` and `"/proj"` produced two
 * different claim keys. `path.resolve` fixes that and nothing else — and it
 * cannot run first: on POSIX a backslash is an ordinary filename character,
 * so resolving `"/proj\\sub"` before folding yields
 * `<process.cwd()>/proj\sub`, a different root entirely. That is the #2526 R2
 * spelling case (`tests/clients/config-resolved-phase.test.ts`, "a /-vs-\
 * spelling of one root does not buy a second row"), which caught exactly this
 * ordering while it was wrong. Resolving here rather than at
 * each caller is what makes the keys identical BY CONSTRUCTION: the callers
 * do not agree today (`initLSPConfig` passes its registry-resolved cwd,
 * `clients/runtime-session.ts`'s two warm-path `loadLSPConfig` calls pass the
 * session cwd verbatim, and `analysisRoot` from `.pi-lens.json` can carry a
 * trailing slash), and a per-caller normalization is exactly the shape 1
 * defect this key keeps being bitten by — the write form and the read form
 * diverging because two sites each folded the path their own way.
 *
 * It is also the key `clients/lsp/session-roots.ts` stores its roots under,
 * once composed: the registry key is `path.resolve(cwd)`, and this function
 * applied to it is idempotent, so `forgetConfigResolvedClaims` releases
 * exactly the claim `recordConfigResolved` took.
 */
function configResolutionKey(cwd: string): string {
	// Fold first (separators, Windows casing), canonicalize second (trailing
	// separators, relative segments), fold again so the result keeps the
	// forward-slash shape every producer and the analyzer already compare on.

/**
 * Announce, at the instant a resolution is actually about to be attempted,
 * that THIS session expects a `config_resolved` row (#2526 review round 3,
 * S1).
 *
 * Round 2 PREDICTED this from three flags in `runtime-session.ts`
 * (`no-lsp`/`subagent`/`warm-attach`), each mirroring one gate the resolution
 * paths themselves check — and the mirror drifted: quick and minimal mode's
 * SECOND session in one process schedule no resolution at all
 * (`ensureLSPConfigInitialized`'s `_lspConfigInitializedCwds` memo skips the
 * synchronous resolve past the first session, and only FULL mode's deferred
 * `setImmediate` reschedules one), so the predicate kept saying
 * `expected=true` for a session that was never going to resolve, and the
 * analyzer flagged a real session every time under `PI_LENS_STARTUP_MODE=quick`
 * or `=minimal`. STOP PREDICTING: this function is called from `loadLSPConfig`
 * itself rather than from any of its callers' decision points, because
 * `loadLSPConfig` is the ONE funnel every production caller reaches —
 * `initLSPConfig` (`ensureLSPConfigInitialized`'s first-session-per-cwd path
 * in index.ts, the MCP `ensureReady` boot via `ensureLspConfig`,
 * `igniteWarmFiles`/`igniteDominantLanguageWarm`) and the two direct calls in
 * `runtime-session.ts` (the full-mode deferred `setImmediate` load and the
 * quick-mode warm-up's LSP pre-warm). Placing the mark here rather than at
 * each of those four sites buys three things: (a) it fires exactly when a
 * resolution is genuinely attempted, never merely decided likely; (b) a
 * session that never reaches ANY of those sites — quick or minimal mode's
 * second-and-later session in a process, for the same root — never gets a
 * mark, so the analyzer silently excludes it instead of counting it against;
 * (c) this mark and {@link recordConfigResolved}'s row are stamped from the
 * SAME `currentSessionRecordId()` read, a few lines apart in one function
 * call, so they can never disagree about which session they belong to —
 * writing the mark at each scheduling site instead (e.g. before a
 * `setImmediate`) would let a session boundary between scheduling and
 * execution attribute the two halves to different sessions.
 *
 * Written unconditionally — before {@link resolvePiLensConfig} can throw —
 * so a resolution that is entered but fails mid-flight leaves a mark with no
 * row, which the analyzer's join reads as "expected and never happened"
 * rather than silently matching "never expected at all".
 *
 * Carries `root=<configResolutionKey(cwd)>` (#2552 review round 4, MEDIUM): the
 * warm MCP server keeps ONE session id for the life of the process but calls
 * this once per SERVED ROOT (`ensureReady` per root, `mcp/server.ts`) — a
 * session-id-only mark let one root's `config_resolved` row silently clear
 * every OTHER root's deficit under the same id, reintroducing review round
 * 2's F3 defect one layer up, at the analyzer's join instead of the claim.
 * The value is the SAME {@link configResolutionKey} string
 * {@link recordConfigResolved} uses for its claim scope and its row's
 * `filePath`, so the mark and the row compare equal without the analyzer
 * re-deriving any path normalization of its own.

 * string only when `path.resolve` is the identity on that cwd: a trailing
