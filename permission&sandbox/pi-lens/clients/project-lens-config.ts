/**
 * Project-level `.pi-lens.json` config loader.
 *
 * Reads an optional `.pi-lens.json` (or `pi-lens.json`) at the project root and
 * surfaces the fields the rest of pi-lens honors:
 *
 *   - `ignore` — gitignore-style glob patterns added to every scan (LSP walk,
 *     fact-rules, tree-sitter, jscpd, knip, review graph, source-filter). Wired
 *     into `getProjectIgnoreMatcher` in `file-utils.ts` via the existing
 *     `createProjectIgnoreMatcher(rootDir, extraPatterns)` extension point.
 *
 *   - `rules` — per-rule threshold overrides. Currently honored:
 *       rules["high-complexity"].threshold — cyclomatic complexity (default 15)
 *       rules["high-fan-out"].threshold   — distinct-function calls (default 20)
 *
 *   - `maxProjectFiles` — the base project-size scale knob (#776). Read by
 *     `clients/project-scale.ts`'s `getProjectScaleBase`, which derives the
 *     five subsystem size budgets (project-diagnostics scanner, review graph,
 *     startup scan, jscpd, word index) as documented ratios of this value.
 *
 *   - `reviewGraph.maxFiles` — explicit review-graph file-budget override
 *     (#775 R2), for monorepos that want a bigger graph than
 *     `project-scale.ts`'s adaptive taper would derive from
 *     `maxProjectFiles` alone. Tolerantly parsed (numeric strings coerce via
 *     `toPositiveFinite`, same as `maxProjectFiles`) and clamped to
 *     `[100, 20_000]` — a value outside that range is silently clamped
 *     rather than rejected (still an explicit, deliberate opt-in; only a
 *     non-numeric/non-positive value warns and is dropped). Read by
 *     `getReviewGraphMaxFilesDerived`, where it takes precedence over the
 *     taper (but the subsystem's own PRE-EXISTING
 *     `PI_LENS_REVIEW_GRAPH_MAX_FILES` env override still wins outright over
 *     both, unchanged).
 *
 *   - `format.enabled`, `autofix.enabled`, and
 *     `actionableWarnings.autoFix.enabled` — project-owned mutation controls.
 *     These can disable pi-lens writes while leaving diagnostics enabled.
 *
 * The file is loaded once per `(path, mtimeMs)` and cached — editing the file
 * invalidates the cache so the next access sees the new values without
 * restarting pi. Discovery is cached by starting directory and validated by the
 * cached directory mtimes plus the config-file mtime, so hot paths do not repeat
 * candidate-file probes on every dispatch.
 *
 * The loader walks up from the starting directory until it finds a config file
 * (mirroring `lsp/config.ts`'s `loadLSPConfig` so project-monorepos with a
 * `.pi-lens.json` at the repo root work without per-subdir configs).
 *
 * A malformed file is treated as "no config" and logged once — we never want a
 * stray syntax error in user-edited JSON to break diagnostics.
 *
 * `findPiLensConfigInDir` / `loadPiLensConfigInDir` are the per-directory
 * (no upward walk) counterparts used by `file-utils.ts`'s
 * `getProjectIgnoreMatcher` to layer NESTED `.pi-lens.json` `ignore` fields
 * the same way nested `.gitignore`s are already layered (#783): every
 * ancestor directory between the git root and a scanned file is checked for
 * its own config file, so a package-local `.pi-lens.json`'s `ignore`
 * patterns apply to files inside that package, in addition to (and with
 * higher precedence than) the root config's `ignore` patterns.

/**
 * The directory mtimes this entry's freshness is keyed on: the BEARING chain —
 * `startDir` up to and including the directory that supplied `info` (#2426
 * review round 5, F-C).
 *
 * The walk itself no longer stops at the first bearing directory, because the
 * legacy documents a user is asked to migrate can sit above it. Keying
 * freshness on every directory it VISITS is a different decision, and a bad
 * one: the walk runs to just below `$HOME`, so the entry was invalidated by any
 * churn in an ancestor like `~/Desktop` — a full re-walk, re-read and re-parse
 * of every legacy document, on a hot path, triggered by an unrelated directory.
 *
 * Scoping it back to the bearing chain restores the pre-#2426 invalidation
 * surface exactly. Nothing that decides a VALUE is outside that chain, and an
 * already-discovered legacy document above it carries its own (mtime, size)
 * stamp in `legacySources`, so an EDIT to one is still noticed. What is given
 * up is noticing a legacy file NEWLY CREATED above the bearing directory
 * mid-process — records-only, and strictly more than the pre-#2426 loader saw,
 * since it never looked above that directory at all.
 *
 * When NO config file is found anywhere (#2483), `info` is undefined and there
 * is no bearing directory to stop at — but the majority of projects have no
 * config at all, so this is the COMMON case, not an edge one. Falling back to
 * the full chain here (the pre-fix behavior) keyed freshness on every
 * directory up to just below `$HOME`: unrelated churn in `~/Desktop` or
 * `~/projects` invalidated the entry and forced a full re-walk on the very
 * next load, every load, forever.
 *
 * The nearest directory a config COULD have appeared in is `startDir` itself
 * — `dirMtimes[0]`, first in the innermost-first walk order (`configSearchDirs`)
 * — so that is what per-call freshness is scoped to, the same bearing-directory
 * principle as the presence case (a directory always includes itself as the
 * degenerate bearing chain). A config file created directly in `startDir`
 * bumps `startDir`'s own mtime and is found on the next load.
 *
 * A config file created further up the chain does not move `startDir`'s own
 * mtime, so it is invisible to THIS check alone (round 1 of #2483 stopped
 * here, leaving staleness unbounded — no production caller ever resets the
 * cache and a same-`startDir` load never rediscovers). `discoveryCacheStillFresh`
 * closes that gap: a no-`info` entry is force-expired at most once per
 * `FRESHNESS_CADENCE_MS`, independent of what `dirMtimes` says, which sends
 * the NEXT load through a full re-walk of the ancestor chain regardless — so
 * a config created anywhere in it is noticed within one cadence window.
 * Bounded staleness, and strictly narrower than the pre-fix "any ancestor up
 * to $HOME invalidates on every load".
