/**
 * #2504 — bounds on the per-turn test-runner fan-out.
 *
 * The reported turn fired 59 `vitest.cmd` spawns at once from a bare
 * `Promise.allSettled(targets.map(...))`. Each spawn carries its OWN 60 s
 * timeout (`test-runner-client.ts`), which bounds one target and says nothing
 * about the batch: 59 of them starved the event loop for the whole turn
 * (`cpuCoverageRatio 0.56`, 20 orphan-backstop escalations inside the storm).
 *
 * Three separate bounds, because they fail differently:
 *  - CONCURRENCY caps how much CPU the batch can hold at one instant;
 *  - TARGET COUNT caps how much work one turn may enqueue at all;
 *  - the WALL BUDGET caps how long the batch may keep spawning, and is raced
 *    against the ambient abort signal so a cancelled turn stops dispatching
 *    immediately rather than at the next natural boundary.
 *
 * #2522: the batch budget shipped at 90 s in #2509 — well over the turn
 * itself, so a slow/hung batch could still hold up the agent for most of a
 * turn before the bound even engaged. Reconciled down to 20 s (one constant,
 * not a second budget alongside it): well under the turn, and still an order
 * of magnitude below the PER-TARGET 60 s cap in `test-runner-client.ts`, so
 * the batch bound is the one that actually fires first for a stuck target.
 *
 * #2522 review round 2: lowering the budget on its own made things WORSE,
 * because the "deferred to the next turn" this comment used to claim did not
 * exist. `runTestTargetsBounded` returned a skipped COUNT and threw the
 * identity of the unrun targets away, so a target slower than the budget
 * produced no result, no cache record and no output — every turn, forever —
 * while a PARTIAL batch fell through to the clean branch and was reported as
 * "all tests passed". The deferral is now a real mechanism:
 *
 *  - the batch owns an `AbortController` that is handed to each target's spawn
 *    (`TestRunRequest.signal` → `safeSpawnAsync`), so reaching the bound KILLS
 *    what is in flight instead of leaving it to burn its own 60 s timeout and
 *    then mutate a results array the caller has already consumed;
 *  - the killed set plus the never-dispatched set is returned BY IDENTITY as
 *    `deferred`, persisted on the `test-runner-findings` record as
 *    `deferredTargets`, and dispatched FIRST on the next turn — ahead of
 *    failed-first/related/self — under the same `TEST_RUNNER_MAX_TARGETS` cap;
 *  - a batch whose `deferred` set is non-empty can never take the clean
 *    branch, so an unfinished run is never reported as a green one and never
 *    relaxes the `--lens-guard` commit gate.

	 * inheriting one.
	 *
	 * Review F1: the population is what the footer RENDERED since the last
	 * turn end, drained here — not every file that merely holds a demoted
	 * row. The footer draws one record per pass (`withBlocking[0]`, its top
	 * five entries) and may not be drawn at all, so a per-turn walk of the
	 * whole store charged deliveries the agent never received and retired a
	 * delivery early. This is the widget-surface analogue of the inline
	 * loop's own `pendingDependencyDriftDeliveries` deferral below: both
	 * commit a delivery only once the surface has actually served it. Every
	 * `deliveryCount` reported to the ledger is therefore a count of RENDERS.
	 *
	 * Fix-round 3 (#2275 review F1): this drain/charge MUST run before the
	 * `files.length === 0` early return below — a read-only turn (no
	 * modified files) still repaints the footer and can draw a demoted row,
	 * so a cap that only charged deliveries below the early return silently
	 * starved on quiet turns: the footer re-rendered the same demoted row
	 * every turn while the delivery count never advanced. The drain is a
	 * Set.take() plus one map lookup per drained file — cheap enough to run
	 * unconditionally on every turn end.
