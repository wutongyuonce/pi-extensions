/**
 * Tree-sitter Tree Cache
 *
 * Caches parsed ASTs so a file written once is parsed once and reused by every
 * subsystem that inspects it in the same process (#675).
 *
 * Freshness is hash-authoritative when the caller supplies content: identical
 * bytes parse to an identical tree, so a hash match is a hit even if the file's
 * mtime moved (an agent re-saving unchanged bytes must not force a reparse,
 * #890). Eviction is true LRU — hits re-insert their entry, so set() dropping
 * the Map's first key removes the least-recently-used file, not merely the
 * oldest insertion, and hot per-edit files survive scan traffic (#890).
