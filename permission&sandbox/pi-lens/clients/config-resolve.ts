/**
 * The ONE config resolution path (#2426).
 *
 * Every pi-lens config file — canonical or legacy, project or global — is read,
 * validated and layered here, through `config-core`'s `resolveConfig` over the
 * canonical schema in `config-schema.ts`. The three exported loaders
 * (`loadLSPConfig`, `loadPiLensGlobalConfig`, `loadPiLensProjectConfig`) keep
 * their names and return types and become PROJECTIONS of what this module
 * resolves, so their ~20 call sites are untouched.
 *
 * THE DOCUMENTED LOOKUP ORDER, lowest precedence first:
 *
 *   builtin -> global -> project root -> nested-project -> env -> cli -> host
 *
 * It is `config-core`'s own `SOURCE_TIERS`, not a second ordering: this
 * module places files into tiers and the core sorts them. `docs/configuration.md`
 * documents the same order once, and `tests/clients/config-resolve.test.ts`
 * walks it.
 *
 * Only THREE of those tiers are populated here — `global`, `project` and
 * `nested-project` — because those are the tiers config FILES live in.
 * `builtin`, `env`, `cli` and `host` are reserved (#2427 wires env/CLI, #2416
 * the host tier); today's env vars and CLI flags reach a setting through their
 * own accessors, and `docs/configuration.md` states that precedence rather than
 * implying this resolution already carries it.
 *
 * WITHIN a tier, the canonical file is added LAST and therefore wins, because
 * `merge` keeps caller order on a precedence tie. That is the whole deprecation
 * story in one line: a legacy file is still read, and it loses to the file the
 * user is being told to move to.
 *
 * LEGACY ROOT LSP KEYS ARE NORMALIZED INTO THE `lsp` NAMESPACE HERE, at source
 * injection, and nowhere else (#2427 review round 2, F1). Every LSP setting has
 * two spellings during the deprecation window — `disabledServers` at a
 * document's root and `lsp.disabledServers` inside it — and leaving both in
 * place gave the schema TWO nodes for one setting. `merge()` then resolved each
 * node independently: two deny unions that never saw each other's tiers, and
 * two object merges that never saw each other's entries. A projection could
 * only pick one, and picking the canonical one meant a global denial written in
 * the legacy spelling disappeared the moment any project file mentioned the
 * canonical one — the operator-denial-lifted-by-repository-content defect
 * #2415 AC 3 forbids, arriving through the migration instead of through the
 * merge strategy.
 *
 * An earlier draft rejected this rewrite because it would inject an `lsp` key
 * into `PiLensProjectConfig.raw` that was never in the user's file. That
 * objection is why the normalization lives HERE and not in
 * `resolveOnePiLensConfigDocument`: `.raw` comes from the single-document path,
 * which still merges a document exactly as written. Only this multi-document
 * resolution — whose two consumers are `loadLSPConfig` and `effectiveConfig`,
 * both of which read the `lsp` section and nothing else — normalizes.
 *
 * The mapping is `canonicalKeyFor`'s, the one the deprecation records already
 * publish, so "where does this key move to" is answered once. Within a single
 * document the canonical spelling still wins a collision, which is the rule
 * `lspSectionOf` used to apply at projection time; across documents `merge()`
 * now applies the ordinary tier precedence and the deny union to ONE node.

 * internal failure into three notices, one of them announcing an "LSP config"
 * problem in a file with no LSP settings in it. `config-core`'s own
