/**
 * Turn-boundary freshness gate for cached inline blockers (#1631).
 *
 * An inline blocker recorded for a file F is a verdict about F *and everything F
 * imports*. The existing invalidation paths all key on F alone — a later dispatch
 * of the SAME path returning no blockers, the path ceasing to exist (#1245), and a
 * fresh confirmed-clean verdict (#1561/#1573). When only a DEPENDENCY of F changes,
 * none of those events fire, so F's stale verdict re-served at every turn end for
 * the rest of the session. The live instances in #1631 are exactly that shape: the
 * missing export was added to the dependency (one via a bash script, so the
 * dependency was never dispatched at all — even the same-path event was unreachable
 * by construction).
 *
 * The gate here is a READ-time freshness sweep, not the #1561 dependency-axis
 * invalidation (which stays blocked on a maintainer design decision). Before a cached
 * blocking finding is re-served at turn end, stat the file and its forward imports.
 * The file's own import list comes from the parse layer — no reverse-dependency index
 * is needed, sidestepping the tests-free-index blocker that holds #1561's remainder.
 *
 * Drifted entries are DEMOTED, not dropped (#1419 precedent, as applied by sibling
 * issue #1622): a surviving file whose content drifted gets re-served with a
 * `[stale — re-run to confirm]` marker and out of the authoritative blocker channel,
 * rather than being silently deleted or re-asserted at full authority. The gate never
 * re-pulls LSP verdicts on its own — a drifted entry is marked stale and left for an
 * explicit re-run or the next dispatch to resolve. That keeps the sweep bounded and
 * free of the document-resync hazard the issue calls out (re-querying an LSP whose
 * in-memory dependency document is itself stale would regenerate the stale verdict).
 *
 * Scope (#1631 review F4): an inline blocker is not always LSP-only —
 * `dispatcher.ts` builds it from every `semantic === "blocking"` diagnostic across
 * all runners, so an eslint, biome-check, or ast-grep security-rule (hardcoded
 * secret, CVE) finding can land here too. Only a language-server verdict is
 * actually invalidated by an IMPORT changing; an ast-grep secret match doesn't stop
 * being true because a file it imports was edited.
 *
 * Self-drift axis (#1561 remainder). That reasoning covers the import axis and
 * nothing else, but the original gate discarded BOTH axes for a non-LSP record:
 * entries whose `sources` were not all `"lsp"` skipped the check entirely. A
 * tree-sitter verdict about F's own syntax is emphatically invalidated by F's own
 * bytes changing, and no other path could clear it —
 * `retireInlineBlockerOnConfirmedClean` requires `coveredSources` to be a superset
 * of the record's sources, `coveredSourcesForCheck` builds that set from the LSP
 * server registry, and no registered server has id `"tree-sitter"`, so the retire
 * could never fire however many clean checks ran. Live shape: a
 * `ts-incomplete-assertion` blocker re-served every turn for the rest of a session
 * against a file already proven clean by grep, LSP, and a passing test.
 *
 * So the sweep now runs over every entry that HAS recorded provenance, and picks
 * the axis from the sources: all-`"lsp"` gets the own-file-plus-forward-imports
 * walk, anything else (tree-sitter, ast-grep, mixed, or `"unknown"`) gets an
 * own-file-only check. A record with NO recorded sources stays fail-closed and
 * untouched, matching the test `retireInlineBlockerOnConfirmedClean` applies before
 * it will retire.
 *
 * The self axis is CONTENT-CONFIRMED and RE-ARMING, and those two properties are
 * why it carries its own `"self-drift"` reason rather than reusing
 * `"dependency-drift"` (#2982 review).
 *
 * Content-confirmed: mtime moving is not evidence a byte moved. A `touch`, a
 * `git checkout` restoring identical bytes, or a no-op formatter pass all move
 * it. #2449 round 2 F7 settled this for `observed-mutation.ts` ("mtime-only
 * drift has to be confirmed against content before anything is replayed"), and
 * it binds harder here, where an unconfirmed demotion walks a finding out of the
 * authoritative channel. `detectSelfDrift` applies that rule at both tiers:
 * `size` first, then a sha256 of the bytes when size cannot separate a
 * one-character edit from a `touch`. A same-LENGTH change is the common shape,
 * not an exotic one (a renamed identifier of equal length, a flipped comparison,
 * a changed digit), so a size-only tier would leave a genuinely changed record
 * authoritative, which is #2982 arriving from the other side. The baseline is
 * carried by `PipelineResult` beside the inline-blocker evidence and stamped
 * synchronously by `recordInlineBlockers`. Every bound that expires, and every missing baseline, yields
 * `unverifiable`, which changes no state in either direction and is counted so
 * it is visible rather than silent.
 *
 * Re-arming: `setInlineBlockerSelfDriftStale` re-derives the verdict every turn
 * and un-demotes a record whose bytes come back, exactly as
 * `setInlineBlockerPastEofStale` does for a transient shrink-then-restore. That
 * is what lets this axis stay OUT of the #1950 delivery cap. The cap retires a
 * record permanently after `DEPENDENCY_DRIFT_MAX_DELIVERIES` stale deliveries,
 * which suits recoverable LSP dependency drift; a self-drift record can carry
 * ast-grep or tree-sitter security provenance, and retiring one because an
 * advisory was shown three times would walk a hardcoded secret out of turn-end
 * rendering with no dispatch to re-raise it. A record that heals on its own
 * needs no bounded-noise retirement.
 *
 * Defect shape 24 is satisfied by composition, not by reusing a string: the new
 * reason has per-writer semantics (re-arm, no cap), and like every sibling gate
 * it never touches a demotion another gate made and never heals one it did not
 * make. The commit gate is unaffected either way. `updateGitGuardStatus` counts
 * `getInlineBlockersSnapshot().length` with no `stale` filter, so a demoted
 * record still gates a commit; `tests/clients/blocker-freshness.test.ts` pins
 * that, because it is what makes widening this sweep to security provenance
 * safe at all.
 *
 * Resolution boundary (#1631 review F8): `extractForwardImportPaths` parses static
 * import/require syntax via tree-sitter. It does not, and cannot, resolve a
 * dependency reached only through a dynamic `import()` or `require()` behind a
 * runtime condition — that edge is invisible to this gate, so a blocker whose only
 * stale dependency arrives that way survives a replay. This is an honest boundary,
 * not a silently-closed one.
 *
 * Delivery cap (#1950). A demoted-but-confirmable entry (`alreadyStale` above)
 * is deliberately NOT retired after its past-EOF sibling's one-delivery rule
 * (#1944, `blocker-past-eof.ts`) — its coordinates are still in bounds, so a
 * fresh dispatch can genuinely confirm or clear it, and retiring on delivery
 * one would discard a recoverable finding. But nothing capped how many times
 * the SAME demoted record re-serves: incident data (#1944's lane sweep) showed
 * 18 `alreadyStale` re-serves in one window, with repeat deliveries carrying
 * near-zero information after the first. `runtime-turn.ts` counts each
 * delivery (`InlineBlockerRecord.staleDeliveryCount`) and retires the record
 * via `RuntimeCoordinator.retireDemotedDependencyDriftBlocker` once it reaches
 * `DEPENDENCY_DRIFT_MAX_DELIVERIES` — a count, not a TTL or a session
 * boundary, because "how many times has the agent already been told" is the
 * quantity that actually went to zero information, not "how much time has
 * passed". The ledger reason says "capped, re-run can still confirm" so it
 * reads distinctly from #1944's "retired, unrecoverable" — a capped record
 * COULD still resolve a fresh dispatch; it just stopped being handed one for
 * free.
 *
 * Widget-footer sibling (#2275). The turn-end blocker channel above is not
 * the only surface that demotes on dependency drift — `widget-state.ts`'s
 * own `files` map carries the identical demotion shape
 * (`markWidgetFileBlockersStale`) through a completely separate store, with
 * its own `WidgetDiagnostic.staleDeliveryCount` and its own retire helpers
 * (`incrementWidgetDependencyDriftDelivery`,
 * `retireWidgetDependencyDriftBlockers`). It counts RENDERS rather than
 * turn ends — the footer draws one record per pass, so `renderWidget` marks
 * what it served and the turn-end step drains those marks — and it retires
 * by HIDING the row from the footer rather than dropping the record, since
 * the widget store also backs `lens_diagnostics mode=all`. What it shares
 * with this module is the one number both caps retire against,
 * `DEPENDENCY_DRIFT_MAX_DELIVERIES`, rather than inventing a second one.

 * just one store removed from F1's. The widget row's eligibility belongs to the
 * WIDGET STORE, not to whatever inline entry happens to share its file path; an
 * ineligible duplicate therefore gets its own separate population row instead
 * of being chained, so a file can legitimately count twice (once per store) when
 * the two stores disagree on eligibility.
