/**
 * The observational mutation net (#2430).
 *
 * ## What it is
 *
 * `clients/mutating-tool.ts` classifies a mutation by NAME or by input SHAPE.
 * Both tiers are finite and the population of third-party edit tools is not, so
 * a tool pi-lens has never met is dropped before the first bookkeeping call —
 * no read-guard stamp, no `turn-state.json` entry, no deferred format.
 *
 * This module makes detection OBSERVATIONAL. It watches a bounded file set
 * around a call the seam could not classify, and if something changed it
 * replays the change through the mutation bridge as a real `kind: "edit"`. The
 * tool is then ATTRIBUTED (`clients/mutation-attribution.ts`), so a later
 * session on the same project classifies it from disk with no snapshot at all.
 *
 * Three layers, cheapest first:
 *
 * 1. **Nothing at all** for a tool the seam already classifies. `arm` is never
 *    reached: `runtime-tool-call.ts` only calls in when `classifyMutatingTool`
 *    returned `undefined` or the attribution is still provisional, and the
 *    first thing `arm` does is a map lookup.
 * 2. **Arm + diff** for an unclassified call whose input carries a path-shaped
 *    field, bounded to THAT PATH ALONE. Paid at most a handful of times per
 *    tool name per session (see `CLEAN_OBSERVATION_ARM_LIMIT` and
 *    `PERSIST_AFTER_OBSERVATIONS`).
 * 3. **The settled sweep** at `agent_settled`, before the deferred drain, for
 *    tools with no path field at all. It stat-checks the tracked-file set
 *    incrementally and NEVER walks the workspace.
 *
 * ## The observation universe is the TARGET PATH (#2449 review round 2)
 *
 * The first cut snapshotted the target's whole DIRECTORY plus the tracked-file
 * set. That was wrong in both directions and expensive in a third:
 *
 * - it attributed a SIBLING's change to the tool under observation, so a
 *   background write during a `read`-shaped call taught pi-lens that `read`
 *   mutates (round-2 finding F4);
 * - it made the arm cost scale with directory size and tracked-set size
 *   (~44ms warm), for a verdict about ONE path;
 * - it duplicated the settled sweep's job. The tracked set is the SWEEP's
 *   domain; the armed observation's domain is the path the tool named.
 *
 * So the universe is now: the path-shaped field's file, or — when that path is
 * a DIRECTORY — that directory's own entries, non-recursively, capped at
 * {@link OBSERVED_TARGET_DIR_MAX_ENTRIES}. Nothing else. A tool that changes a
 * file it never named is the settled sweep's business, not the armed
 * observation's, and the sweep says so honestly rather than guessing.
 *
 * When that cap BITES the observation is truncated, and a truncated
 * observation is `unverifiable` — never clean (#2449 review round 3, S3). The
 * first cut broke out of the readdir loop silently, so a codemod that rewrote
 * the 84th entry of an 84-entry directory produced an empty diff, the empty
 * diff advanced the clean latch, and two of those stopped pi-lens watching a
 * tool that mutates on every call.
 *
 * ## What layer 3 cannot see, stated rather than hidden
 *
 * The sweep compares against a ledger seeded from files pi-lens has ALREADY
 * seen. A file that was never read, never written, never diagnosed and never
 * opened by a language server has no baseline, so its first drift only seeds
 * the ledger and is not reported. That is the documented limitation in #2430's
 * third acceptance criterion; the alternative is a workspace walk, which the
 * issue rules out.
 *
 * The sweep is also INCREMENTAL (round-2 finding F3). A full hash of 400
 * tracked files cannot finish inside a 200ms capture budget, so the first cut
 * timed out at every realistic size and never ran at all. It now stats a
 * bounded window per turn from a carried cursor, reads a file only when its
 * size or mtime actually moved, and reports its own coverage
 * (`scanned`/`remaining`/`cursor`) so a partial pass is never read as a clean
 * one.
 *
 * ## Bounds (AGENTS.md async rule, both directions)
 *
 * Every ASYNC step here carries a TIMEOUT and an `AbortSignal` race, and every
 * capture is additionally bounded by a file cap and a hash-byte budget. The
 * ARM shares a per-turn wall-clock budget; exhausting it emits a bounded
 * `observed_mutation_budget_exhausted` record and a degradation-ledger tally —
 * it is never a silent skip (catalog shape 10).
 *
 * The SETTLE is ASYNC and deliberately NOT budget-gated. Round 2 made it
 * synchronous to keep `handleToolResult` from yielding before it dispatches
 * the pipeline (#1086); round 3 (T4) removed the sync filesystem work from the
 * tool_result path instead and made the ORDER explicit at the call site: the
 * classified chain reads everything it derives from the post-result bytes
 * BEFORE the settle's yield, so a racing tool_result for the same path cannot
 * make this call register under the other call's state hash. Only the
 * pending-baseline PROBE (`hasPendingObservation`) stays synchronous, which is
 * what keeps the cost on the overwhelmingly common no-baseline path at one map
 * lookup.
 *
 * A settle clamped to a spent budget silently dropped real mutations (round-2
 * findings F1 and F5), so the settle has its own deadline rather than the
 * arm's leftovers. The snapshot already exists and the post-capture always
 * runs its first entry, so it completes for the target path whatever the clock
 * says; a directory target's remaining entries are the only part a deadline
 * can cut, and a cut capture says so rather than scoring itself clean.

/**
 * Re-baseline pi-lens's OWN writes AFTER the deferred drain.
 *
 * The drain is pi-lens formatting and autofixing files it already knows about,
 * so those bytes are ours. Without this the next settle would read them as
 * third-party drift and requeue the same files forever.
 *
 * ## The traversal is `handled`, not the tracked set (#2449 review round 5, F2)
 *
 * Every file this function needs to re-baseline is, by construction, already
 * in `handled`: that set exists exactly to name "pi-lens wrote these bytes
 * this run" (see `noteMutationHandled`), and this function's only job is to
 * clear that claim once the ledger agrees. Walking `getTrackedPaths()`
 * instead — the earlier shape — coupled this function's cost and completion
 * to the size of the TRACKED set (up to `OBSERVED_TRACKED_MAX_FILES`, i.e.
 * 400) rather than to the size of the DRAIN (a handful of files), and on a
 * tracked set too large to finish inside `OBSERVED_CAPTURE_BUDGET_MS` the
 * pass parked at the same prefix every turn — `report: false` always starts
 * its cursor at 0 — so files in the tail never got re-baselined and their
 * `handled` marks never retired, permanently suppressing drift reports for
 * them (reviewer PROBE-B1).
 *
 * `handled` is bounded by `OBSERVED_HANDLED_MAX` and holds only files the
 * pipeline or the drain actually wrote this run, so iterating it is
 * O(handful) rather than O(tracked set) and — barring an aborted turn or a
 * genuinely pathological handled-set size — completes in one pass every time.
 * That is what lets every mark retire on every refresh instead of only the
 * marks a rotating cursor happened to reach.
 *
 * ## The retirement is still per FILE (#2449 review rounds 3 (S5) and 4 (S2))
 *
 * A mark is dropped exactly when the ledger has been moved onto the
 * POST-drain bytes for that same file — inside the scan, one file at a time
 * (see `rebaseline`) — rather than all-or-nothing on completion. An aborted
 * or truncated pass therefore still retires the marks for the files it DID
 * reach and correctly leaves the rest standing; it no longer needs a
 * dedicated "coverage gap" record to stay honest, because the traversal it
 * covers is the whole of what it was asked to do.
