 * | PostToolUse hook   | `requestWarmAnalyze` — connect                 | hook cwd |
 * | Stop hook          | `requestWarmTurnEnd` — connect                 | hook cwd |

 *
 * Every row is a SEPARATE process that must reproduce the same 16 hex
 * characters with no shared state, and the rows do not run at the same time —
 * the server derives its id at launch, a hook derives its own minutes or hours
 * later. `normalizeMapKey`/`normalizeFilePath` would make the id depend on
 * filesystem state (`realpathSync.native`, on-disk casing) read at two
 * different moments: a case-only rename, a remounted symlink, or a hook running
 * in a different mount namespace than the server would silently stop the two
 * from meeting. That is the exact staleness PR #2193 was rejected for on the
 * LSP seam. `normalizeEphemeralMapKey` is excluded by its own contract — it is
 * scoped to process-local, same-run keys and says so.
 *
 * So the derivation stays pure string math — and #3255 narrowed its case fold
 * to the platforms whose FILESYSTEM folds case, because "pure" and
 * "unconditional" are not the same thing:
 *
 * - case-INSENSITIVE default (`win32`, `darwin` APFS/HFS+): `Alpha` and `alpha`
 *   are ONE directory, so the only failure mode is a MISS. The server row and
 *   the hook rows can hold different spellings of it — the server's cwd can be
 *   a hand-written `--cwd=` / `PI_LENS_MCP_CWD` while the hook's comes from the
 *   payload (see `tests/mcp/turn-end-route.smoke.test.ts`'s win32 case) — so the
 *   fold is what makes them meet, and it stays. `darwin` belongs here for a
 *   reason in this tree, not by analogy: the incumbent selection that decides
 *   two sessions share a root already compares through `normalizeFilePath`
 *   (`clients/instance-registry.ts:837`), whose `realpathSync.native` returns
 *   on-disk casing on Darwin. A pair that SELECTS each other case-insensitively
 *   must be able to MEET.
 * - case-SENSITIVE (Linux, *BSD): `Alpha` and `alpha` are TWO directories, and
 *   two spellings of one workspace cannot occur (a mis-cased `--cwd=` names a
 *   directory that does not exist). Folding there bought nothing and collided
 *   two workspaces onto one socket and one status file — #3255.
 *
 * Known residuals, both fail-safe and both un-closable without a filesystem
 * read this derivation is forbidden to do: a case-insensitive MOUNT on a
 * case-sensitive platform (`nocase` vfat/ntfs3/cifs, ext4 `chattr +F`) now
 * misses instead of meeting — the same blind spot `normalizeFilePath` has
 * there, measured and filed as #3154 — and a case-SENSITIVE APFS volume keeps
 * today's collision.
 *
 * `platform` is an argument, not a `process.platform` read, so every arm is
 * testable from one lane (the seam `normalizePathEntry` uses in

 * once, and the caller's `onOverflow` decides the ending.
 *
 * The bound is on the FRAME, never on what is left over after a chunk's last
 * newline (#3388 review H3388-1). The first version checked only the
 * newline-free remainder, so a peer whose over-limit frame arrived with its
 * newline in the SAME `data` chunk — which is what a single TCP segment or one
 * `socket.write` produces — had its whole line dispatched, bound bypassed:
 * measured at 33,554,433 bytes delivered, 0 overflow callbacks, 0 records. So
 * each complete line is accounted for BEFORE it is dispatched, retained prefix
 * included, and the remainder check below is now only the unterminated case.
 *
 * RESYNC applies to the unterminated case alone. A discarded UNTERMINATED line
 * has a newline still to come, so framing skips to it and the next well-formed
 * line is read normally rather than parsed as the dropped line's tail. A
 * discarded COMPLETE line is already past its own newline, so framing continues
 * from there — resyncing would eat the next line instead.
 *
 * Returns the handler to attach to the stream's `data` event.
