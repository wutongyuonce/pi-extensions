	/**
	 * Retire a file's inline blocker because a FRESH, content-bound diagnostic
	 * verdict proved it gone (#1561).
	 *
	 * The map was invalidated by exactly two events: a later dispatch of the
	 * SAME path returning no blockers, and that path ceasing to exist (#1245).
	 * Neither covers the common case that produced #1561 — a blocker on file F
	 * whose cause lives in file G. Fixing G re-dispatches G, not F, so F's
	 * verdict was never re-taken and "Unresolved from this turn" was re-injected
	 * for the rest of the session. In the live case the agent then ran
	 * `lsp_diagnostics` on F, pi-lens answered "confirmed clean", and the
	 * blocker was STILL re-served on the next three turn ends: #571 wired that
	 * tool's confirmed result into the widget footer and stopped there.
	 *
	 * This is the seam #1198 invariant 4 left undecided, decided: an affirmative
	 * clean from the authoritative current view retires the stale verdict.
	 *
	 * Ordering (#1198 invariants 1-2). Both stores draw from the same
	 * `nextWriteIndex()` counter, so when both sides are stamped the retire
	 * requires the clean verdict to be strictly NEWER. A slow old clean that
	 * settles after a fresh dispatch found real blockers must not erase them.
	 * When either side is unstamped the two cannot be ordered at all; the fresh
	 * confirmed verdict wins, because it is the only one of the two backed by an
	 * actual observation of current content. Only production's single record site
	 * is stamped, so in practice the unstamped branch is legacy callers/tests.
	 *
	 * COVERAGE (#1561 F1). A blocker is retired only by a verdict that can speak
	 * for the tools that raised it. Inline blockers come from the whole dispatch,
	 * not just the language server: `dispatcher.ts` collects every
	 * `semantic === "blocking"` diagnostic across all runners, so eslint,
	 * biome-check, actionlint, elixir/gleam-check and ast-grep security rules all
	 * land in this map. A language-server check knows nothing about any of them,
	 * so `coveredSources` must be a SUPERSET of the recorded sources or the entry
	 * stands. This is a commit gate: a record whose provenance is unknown (no
	 * `sources`) fails CLOSED and is never retired, because "we don't know what
	 * raised this" must not resolve to "an LSP check can clear it".
