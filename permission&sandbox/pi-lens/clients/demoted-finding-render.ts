/**
 * Body degradation for a DEMOTED finding (#1944).
 *
 * The demotion gates (#1631 dependency-drift, #1641 past-EOF) move a record
 * out of the authoritative blocker channel and into the advisory channel.
 * Until this module existed they changed the CHANNEL and nothing else: the
 * advisory embedded the blocker body verbatim, so the agent still read
 * "🔴 STOP — 11 issue(s) must be fixed" with dead line numbers under two
 * hedge lines it ignored. Live evidence (session 01a0234c, 2026-08-21): the
 * agent spent four re-run detours and about 7.4k tokens on a record whose
 * coordinates no longer existed, then explained an unrelated REAL blocker
 * away as "mid-edit state" in the same session.
 *
 * The rule this module owns, once, for every gated surface: a demoted body
 * loses its authority vocabulary and its dead coordinates, and it says so in
 * its own words. `clients/finding-delivery-gate.ts` documents the surrounding
 * contract; this is the one implementation of its "Demotion rendering" arm
 * for surfaces that carry a RENDERED BODY rather than a per-diagnostic row.
 * Per-row surfaces (`widget-state.ts`, `tools/lens-diagnostics.ts`) already
 * swap the coordinate for `PAST_EOF_STALE_MARKER` at render time and have no
 * body to degrade.
 *
 * Pure and leaf: no store, no coordinator, no I/O. The caller supplies the
 * dead lines it already computed while deciding to demote, so this module
 * never re-derives a verdict from rendered prose (the
 * re-derivation-vs-correlation screen).

/**
 * Authority vocabulary a demoted body must not carry, with its degraded
 * replacement. Ordered: the full banner rewrite runs first so the narrower
 * fallbacks only ever see text the banner rule did not already cover.
 *
 * This table is the single source of truth for the rule. A surface must not
 * hand-roll its own "strip the STOP" pass — that is how #1631, #1641, and
 * #1664 each ended up with a different answer to the same question.
 *
 * POSITION-ANCHORED (#1944 review F1). These patterns run over the BANNER
 * region only, never the whole body. Diagnostic messages are arbitrary text
 * from arbitrary runners, and they legitimately contain both tokens: the
 * reviewer's probe turned ts(2304) `Cannot find name 'STOP'` into `Cannot
 * find name 'Previously flagged'`, and mangled an English "must be fixed"
 * inside a rule message. Rewriting a finding's own words is a worse defect
 * than the banner it was cleaning up. See `splitBannerRegion`.

 * (`clients/dispatch/utils/format-utils.ts`), reaching the store as
 * `dispatchResult.blockerOutput` -> `PipelineResult.inlineBlockerSummary` ->

 * stored summary. #1944 review round: naming it here as a producer was
 * wrong.) The shape is a header, then one `  L<n>: <message>` row per
 * diagnostic, then indented continuations (`💡 Fix: …`) and an optional
 * `… and N more` tail. So the first cited-line row is the boundary:
 * everything above it is ours to rewrite, everything from it down is the
 * findings' own words.
 *
 * A body with no cited row at all — `formatDiagnostics` omits `L<n>` for a
 * lineless diagnostic — falls back to the first NON-BLANK line. Leading
 * blanks must be skipped rather than counted (#1944 verify round, Edge-D):
 * `formatDiagnostics` opens its output with a newline, so a naive "first
 * line is the banner" rule degrades an empty string and leaves the real
 * header at full authority. Production is currently saved from that only by
 * an undocumented `.trim()` at `clients/pipeline.ts` (`inlineBlockerSummary`),
 * and this module claims to own the rule, so it must hold on its own input.
