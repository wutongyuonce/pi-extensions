// ── Finding-cited path existence (#1461 slice 1) ──────────────────────────────
//
// `validateAdvisoryProvenance` above answers "did the files the agent EDITED
// change since capture?". A cached scanner finding asks a different question:
// "does the file this finding NAMES still exist?". #1460's live case is the gap
// between them — a gitleaks blocker for a directory deleted eleven minutes
// earlier shipped as `current` seven consecutive times, because the edited
// files were all intact and the cited path was never in the envelope.
//
// CONTRACT (the five remaining #1461 slices reuse this verbatim):
//   - Input is any finding shape; the caller supplies `citedPath`, so nothing
//     here knows about gitleaks, trivy, govulncheck, vulture, or delta mode.
//   - A finding whose cited path is absent (ENOENT/ENOTDIR) is DROPPED, not
//     demoted. There is no remediation for a file that is gone — the agent
//     cannot rotate a credential in it or delete a line from it. Content drift
//     on a SURVIVING file stays `validateAdvisoryProvenance`'s job, and that
//     one demotes.
//   - Fail open, never closed: a finding with no cited path, an unreadable
//     path (EACCES/EPERM/EBUSY), or a path past the stat budget is DELIVERED.
//     Unreadable is not absent; a missed drop is noise, a wrong drop is a lost
//     secret.
//   - Bounded cost: findings are deduped by their RAW cited string first —
//     zero filesystem work — before anything pays for `resolveRunnerPath`'s
//     ancestor walk or `normalizeMapKey`'s realpath. A first cut that deduped
//     by the resolved/canonical key instead still ran that expensive step
//     once per FINDING, not once per unique path, because the dedup lookup
//     came after the cost it was meant to avoid: #1461's live 126-finding
//     record measured 72.7ms in that shape, all of it before the first
//     `statSync`. Deduping the raw string first drops the same record to a
//     ~1.6ms median (this repo, Windows, 10-sample bench) — the remaining
//     cost is one canonicalization + one stat per distinct cited string,
//     capped at `MAX_FINDING_PATH_STATS`.
//   - Path identity uses the guard normalizer (`resolveRunnerPath` →
//     `normalizeMapKey`) for the canonical-key dedup and the shape-aware
//     `toProjectRelativePath` for display, so Windows spellings of one path
//     collapse to one stat and one log entry (defect shapes 1 and 2). This
//     helper has no zero-I/O contract of its own to protect — it stats.
//     Slice 3 (delta mode) must find and name its OWN seam before reusing
//     this shape; `formatDeltaMode` (tools/lens-diagnostics.ts) reads only
//     actionable-warnings, code-quality-warnings, and the delta report, none
//     of which any #1461 slice writes yet, so nothing here currently touches
//     it.

//
// Existence is not authority. #1460's gate answers "does the cited file still
// exist?"; #1622's live case is the next question along: "does the cited file
// still look the way the scan saw it?". A gitleaks blocker cited src:397 for
// ~13 minutes after that file was edited, because the 30-minute TTL says the
// CACHE is young and the existence gate says the FILE is there. Neither says
// the LINE NUMBER is still true.
//
// The verdict is three-way, and the middle arm is the security-critical one:
//   - missing → DROP, as #1460. Nothing to remediate in a file that is gone.
//   - stale (mtimeMs > scannedAt + MTIME_DRIFT_TOLERANCE_MS) → DEMOTE, never drop. The secret may well
//     still be there at a shifted line. Dropping would hand an attacker — or
//     an innocent formatter — a one-touch mute button for a real credential.
//     The caller renders demoted findings out of the blocker tier and WITHOUT
//     the cached line number, which is the part that is now untrustworthy.
//   - live → deliver unchanged, at full severity.
//
// Fail-safe on an unparseable/absent `scannedAt`: no staleness verdict at all,
// so the gate degrades to #1460's existence-only behaviour rather than
// demoting the whole store on a clock or format anomaly. Same rule, same
// reason, as `reconcileProjectDiagnosticsSnapshot`.
