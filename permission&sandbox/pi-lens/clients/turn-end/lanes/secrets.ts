/**
 * The turn-end SECRETS lane (#1892): the gitleaks and trivy-secrets stores,
 * their live 🔴 blocker tier and their demoted 🔑 tier.
 *
 * One lane, two stores, on purpose. The two secret scanners do not have a
 * section each: #131 Mode 3 collapses them (and ast-grep's hardcoded-secret
 * rules) BY LOCATION into one report with combined provenance, because a
 * credential flagged by two tools needs rotating once, not twice — and the
 * demoted tier merges the same two stores for the same reason. So "gitleaks"
 * is not a separable delivery lane: splitting it out would leave every
 * rendering rule (the dedupe, the ast-grep enrichment, the cap, both
 * preambles) in the composer, which is the opposite of the extraction. The
 * lane is the delivery contract; the stores are its sources.
 *
 * Registered surfaces (`clients/finding-delivery-gate.ts`):
 * `runtime-turn:secrets-gitleaks`, `runtime-turn:secrets-trivy`,
 * `runtime-turn:stale-secrets-tier`.
 *
 * History this file must not lose (each line below is a shipped defect):
 *
 * - #1617: these findings never passed through `applyDispositions`, so an
 *   agent-marked false-positive re-reported as a 🔴 STOP blocker every turn.
 * - #1625 review: the disposition filter runs AFTER the freshness gate, over
 *   BOTH arms — an fp-marked finding that later goes stale must not reappear
 *   in the demoted tier.
 * - #1622 review M1: a demoted secret keeps its rule id and source; only the
 *   line is withheld. An agent triages `aws-access-token` differently from a
 *   low-confidence `generic-api-key`, and cannot do that from a bare path.
 * - #1622 review M2: the demoted tier is its OWN tier, never `advisoryParts`
 *   ("no action required this turn" directly above copy telling the agent to
 *   re-scan).
