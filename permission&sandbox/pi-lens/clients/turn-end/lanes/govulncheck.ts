/**
 * The turn-end GOVULNCHECK lane (#1892): the session_start-cached Go CVE
 * store, rendered as ONE advisory tier.
 *
 * One lane, one store, one tier — the straight second extraction against the
 * `TurnEndLane` interface, and the first lane that renders an ADVISORY
 * section (see `TurnEndLaneParts.advisoryParts` and ADR 0008's amendment for
 * why that field arrives with this lane rather than with the interface).
 *
 * Registered surface (`clients/finding-delivery-gate.ts`):
 * `runtime-turn:govulncheck-advisory` — mode `gated`, evidence
 * `scannerGates.govulncheck` (the composer's own binding of the shared pass's
 * result, unchanged by this extraction).
 *
 * History this file must not lose (each line below is a shipped defect or a
 * review finding):
 *
 * - #1622 sibling sweep: govulncheck renders a call site as `file:line` off a
 *   session_start snapshot — the same stale-line shape as gitleaks, one tier
 *   lower. A file edited after the scan keeps its CVE and loses its line,
 *   plus the `STALE_LINE_MARKER`.
 * - #1622 review H1: a CVE is pinned by `go.mod`, NOT by the call site, so a
 *   DELETED traced file may not drop it — `onMissing: "demote"` routes a
 *   vanished path into the same arm as an edited one. The first cut dropped
 *   it, and `citedPath` reads only the FIRST filename frame, so one deleted
 *   file in a long trace silently killed a CVE go.mod still pins.
 * - #1694 F1: these findings pass through `filterFindingsByDisposition` with
 *   the SAME `ProjectDiagnostic` identity `lens_diagnostics mode=full`
 *   surfaces, over BOTH freshness arms — a mark made against what the agent
 *   was SHOWN is honoured here too.
 * - #1627 + #1625 review: the post-gate row guard and the post-disposition
 *   row guard are the SAME guard — `render` tests the list it is about to
 *   print, never the raw cache length, or the header prints with zero rows
 *   beneath it whenever either filter empties the list.
