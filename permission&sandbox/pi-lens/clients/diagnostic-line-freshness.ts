/**
 * Past-EOF validity gate for cited diagnostic line numbers (#1641).
 *
 * A live session served diagnostics at lines 407-410 of a file that was 402
 * lines on disk and UNMODIFIED — the LSP's in-memory document had drifted
 * longer than disk without any file write happening (no didChange lost, just
 * an in-memory buffer that grew past what the file actually contains). That
 * makes this a DIFFERENT invariant than #1622/#1627's freshness gate: those
 * compare a cited file's MTIME against a scan timestamp, which says nothing
 * when the file was never touched on disk at all. The cheap, orthogonal check
 * available here is structural: a diagnostic whose start line exceeds the
 * file's CURRENT line count cannot possibly be describing current content,
 * regardless of what any timestamp says.
 *
 * CONTRACT:
 *   - A diagnostic citing a line beyond the file's current line count is
 *     DEMOTED (`stale: true`), never dropped — the underlying issue may well
 *     still be real, just at a coordinate this gate can no longer vouch for.
 *   - RE-ARMS, never latches: the verdict is recomputed from the gate's own
 *     inputs (current mtime, current line count) on every call, so a
 *     TRANSIENT shrink (truncate-then-write, a formatter pass, a checkout)
 *     that later restores the line un-demotes on its own next read. A
 *     persisted `stale: true` a caller stores between calls is a cache of the
 *     last-derived verdict, never an independent source of truth that
 *     overrides the next derivation — the #1633-V1 lesson: derive, don't latch.
 *   - Fail open: a file that cannot be stat'ed/read, or exceeds the size gate,
 *     yields no verdict at all (every diagnostic passes through unchanged).
 *     An unreadable/oversized file is not evidence of anything; demoting on
 *     it would manufacture false staleness.
 *   - The line count matches the LSP's own addressing, not `wc -l`: a
 *     document with N newline characters has N+1 ADDRESSABLE lines (the
 *     line after the final `\n`, or the single line of an empty document,
 *     is a real position a server can anchor a diagnostic to — e.g. TS1005
 *     "'}' expected" at EOF). `WidgetDiagnostic.line` is always
 *     `range.start.line + 1` from that same addressing, so the gate must
 *     use it too or every trailing-newline file demotes its own valid EOF
 *     diagnostics.
 *   - Cost discipline: one `statSync` per served file; the file's newlines
 *     are counted in bounded chunks via a raw fd read (never a full
 *     `readFileSync` — no whole-file string materialization, no per-render
 *     re-read of unchanged content), gated by a byte-size cap matching
 *     `captureReadContentBinding`'s precedent (`read-guard.ts`). The count is
 *     memoized in a small SHARED cache (module-scoped, bounded, evicted FIFO
 *     past a cap), keyed on BOTH mtime AND size (review round V1) — mtime
 *     ALONE is not a reliable cache key on hosts where its resolution is
 *     coarser than back-to-back writes: a truncate-then-write, a formatter
 *     write-back, or pi-lens's own auto-format immediately followed by the
 *     agent's write can land two DIFFERENT contents on the identical
 *     `mtimeMs`, and a mtime-only cache serves the first content's count for
 *     the second — measured live at 207/300 shrink/restore cycles. Requiring
 *     both to match narrows a same-tick collision to same-mtime-AND-same-size
 *     (which a shrink/restore cycle never produces, since the whole point is
 *     the size changed). A changed file is always recounted. Tests can still
 *     inject an isolated {@link LineCountCache} via {@link createLineCountCache}
 *     to avoid cross-test bleed.
 *   - On a demotion EDGE (a diagnostic that was not already flagged past-EOF
 *     and now is), best-effort trigger a document resync (didClose/didOpen or
 *     a full-sync didChange) so the desync HEALS instead of re-serving the
 *     same stale verdict next time (#1631's resync-before-revalidate rule).
 *     Resync is fire-and-forget: a failure here must never block or fail the
 *     render path that discovered the drift. Already-demoted entries and the
 *     healing direction never re-trigger a resync — only the rising edge does.
