## Why

Exactly one sentence explaining the user or maintainer outcome.

## Notes for the reviewer

- Key review constraint, risk, or decision.

## Summary

Describe what this PR changes, why it changes it, and any non-obvious design
decision or gotcha. Name the issue and explain whether every acceptance
criterion is complete.

Closes #NNN — only when every acceptance criterion is met. Otherwise Refs
#NNN AND comment on the issue naming exactly what remains (deferral hygiene).
The reference must ALSO be in the PR title — the title becomes the
merge-commit subject.

Citations: every code fact uses ``path:line``; an offered fenced quote is
checked against the cited source line. Test ids in tables are real `it(` titles;
pre-existing-red claims carry the
`origin/master` transcript.

## Checklist

- [ ] I have read [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) and [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md)
- [ ] The change has tests (happy path, edge cases, regression test for bugs)
- [ ] Targeted test files for the touched seams pass locally after `npm run build`; the full suite is CI's job.
- [ ] Every NEW regression test is proven RED on pre-fix code; the red output is quoted in this PR
- [ ] Every new guard/branch/filter is mutation-proof: deleting or neutering it reds at least one test
- [ ] PR title carries the conventional prefix and the issue ref
- [ ] `npm run lint` passes
- [ ] `npm run build:dist` succeeds if I changed code under `clients/`, `commands/`, `tools/`, or `index.ts`
- [ ] `package-lock.json` is in sync with `package.json` (regenerate with the exact npm pin in `package.json`'s `packageManager` field)
- [ ] `AGENTS.md` is updated if this PR changes behavior, commands, conventions, or invariants documented there
- [ ] `.changelog/<branch-or-slug>-<short-desc>.md` has one valid entry **in this PR** for any user-facing change (Added/Changed/Deprecated/Removed/Fixed/Security) — see [.changelog/README.md](../.changelog/README.md); internal-only test/refactor PRs may skip it
- [ ] Commit subject includes the issue number: `(closes #NNN)` or `(refs #NNN)`

## Tests

Name each NEW test file/case and each EDIT of an existing test, with one line
on what it pins and why it exists (regression proof / contract seam /
occupancy budget). If no tests changed, say so explicitly. Prove new
regression tests RED on pre-fix code and quote the output.

Where it is not obvious, name which of AGENTS.md's ten test-authoring screens each new test satisfies (parallel path, invisible skip, wrong-layer pin, ambient-inspection double, env leakage, loose bound, all-mocks, not-throw, implementation mirror, snapshot-as-behavior).

### Test assessment

For each test FILE this PR touches: one line on what behavior that file
uniquely pins, and any test in it this PR makes redundant. Name removal
candidates. A test may be REMOVED only when a named surviving test reds on
the same mutations — demonstrate the redundancy, never assert it. Removal
candidates you do not delete here go to the corpus value ledger issue.

## Blast radius

State affected dependents for each touched production module (from
`module_report` with `blastRadius: true`), callbacks/entry points, and the
verification plan. If a hot path is touched (per-spawn / per-file /
per-render), state the measured cost delta. Record "empty/unavailable"
explicitly with why.

## Observability

The `PR body` check accepts exactly three forms here, nothing else:

1. the literal record kind this diff ADDS in runtime code (a `kind: "..."`
   passed to `recordDegradationOnce` / `incrementDegradationCount` / a
   `logLatency` phase) — the literal must appear in the added lines;
2. `covered by existing record \`<kind>\` at \`<runtime file>:<line>\`` when
   the new failure path is observed by a record an existing seam already
   emits (the cited line must sit within 20 lines of that literal, in a
   runtime file, no `..` in the path);
3. the exact sentence `No new failure path; no record added.` — valid ONLY
   when the diff adds no `catch`, `throw`, `return null` or degradation
   branch in runtime code.

"name the gap" / "not applicable" are refused. One `## Observability`
section per PR: fix rounds append under `## Round N` and never repeat this
heading — the check reads the FIRST section and a stale first section is
the usual red.

## Class sweep

Name the defect class or shape and record a pattern sweep across the WHOLE
tree — `clients/`, `tools/`, `mcp/`, `scripts/`, `index.ts`, never
`clients/` alone — plus a population sweep with a per-member verdict when
the site belongs to an enumerable family. Cite AGENTS.md's defect-shape
catalog. "Class of size 1" requires the grep that proves it. End a
population sweep with a consolidation verdict: fold the family onto one
seam (issue ref) or state why it stays distributed.
