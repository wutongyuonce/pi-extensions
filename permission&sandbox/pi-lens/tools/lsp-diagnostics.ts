 * in flight at once, regardless of which server they belonged to). That let

 * the SAME shared, single-threaded LSP server — exactly the pattern #387
 * found doesn't parallelize (it queues server-side and cascades per-file
 * timeouts by queue position) and that `runWorkspaceDiagnostics` (the engine
 * behind `lens_diagnostics mode=full`) has been protected against since #387.
 *
 * Groups `items` by primary server via `groupFilesByPrimaryServer` (the same
 * grouping key `runWorkspaceDiagnostics` uses) and schedules them with
 * `runPerServerGroups` (both extracted from `clients/lsp/index.ts` so this
 * tool shares the real primitive instead of a second hand-copied
 * implementation): at most one in-flight `mapper` call per server group,
 * parallelized across distinct groups up to `concurrency`. A single-language
 * batch collapses to one group and runs effectively serially regardless of
 * `concurrency` — the CORRECT, intended #387 behavior, not a regression.
 *
 * Result order matches `items`' original order (not completion order),
 * matching the old flat pool's positional-assignment behavior — callers may
 * depend on `results[i]` corresponding to `items[i]`.
 *
 * #667: before a group's own per-file loop starts, calls the shared
 * `LSPService.ensureWarmForSweep` warm-check/ensure-warm step (the same one
 * `runWorkspaceDiagnostics` uses for `lens_diagnostics mode=full`) against
 * the group's first file — a no-op when that group's primary server already
 * demonstrated readiness earlier this session, one bounded warm-up round
 * trip otherwise. Fixes the first-few-files-eat-cold-start-timeouts pattern
 * for THIS tool's batch/directory sweep the same way #667 fixed it for the
 * workspace-diagnostics sweep.

/**
 * The scan-language DECISION `runDirectoryDiagnostics` makes, pulled out as
 * its own function so `tests/tools/lsp-diagnostics-scan-family.test.ts` can
 * pin it against the golden `LANG_EXTENSIONS` table for every 1- and
 * 2-extension combination in that table's universe without spinning up one
 * real directory (and the full LSP-mocked tool) per combination — `hasMatch`
 * is the only I/O-shaped seam, so the caller decides whether it is backed by
 * a real `collectFiles` walk (production) or an in-memory extension-set probe
 * (tests).
 *
 * Walks `SCAN_LANGUAGE_PRIORITY`'s FAMILIES in order and unions each member
 * id's {@link extensionsForLanguage} into ONE `hasMatch` call — the first
 * family with any match wins the whole directory for this pass. Grouping by
 * family (not trying each id alone) is what makes a directory mixing BOTH
 * extensions of a registry-split pair (`.ts`+`.tsx`, `.css`+`.scss`, ...)
 * behavior-preserving vs the pre-#2434 bundled-key table: a flat per-id loop
 * stopped at the first id with ANY match, silently losing the sibling half of
 * a split pair present in the same directory (#2458 fix-round F1).
