// The full suite occasionally died with a "Worker
// exited unexpectedly" + a `node::GetNodeReport` dump. That report is emitted

// OOM-kill SIGKILLs with no dump — so the crash is a single long-lived worker
// hitting its own V8 heap ceiling, not system memory exhaustion (32-core /
// 68 GB host). With `isolate: true` (vitest's default) each worker's module
// registry is reset per file, so the native addons (the many tree-sitter
// grammars + @ast-grep/napi) are re-loaded and re-compiled file after file.
// CORRECTION (#2042, measured 2026-08-25): this paragraph used to say those
// buffers "accumulate in the reused worker". They do not — Vitest 4's forks
// pool with `isolate: true` spawns a FRESH child process per test file (20
// files at `maxWorkers: 1` produced 20 distinct pids), so a fork's peak is its
// own file's peak and nothing carries over. The cost is per-file, not
// cumulative; it is simply large for the tail (p99 1405 MB, max 2267 MB).
// `execArgv` passes --max-old-space-size to every spawned worker.
// Tune via PI_LENS_TEST_WORKER_HEAP_MB. NOTE: Vitest 4
// flattened the config — `execArgv` is a direct `test` field (the v3
