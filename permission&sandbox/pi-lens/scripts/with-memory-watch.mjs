/**
 * scripts/with-memory-watch.mjs (#2042)
 *
 * Runs a command while sampling host memory, so an OOM kill leaves evidence.
 *
 * The problem it solves is not memory use, it is memory ATTRIBUTION. The CI
 * Unit-tests job was SIGKILLed repeatedly with `Killed npm test` and exit 137
 * and zero failing assertions. That output names no file, no process, and no
 * number, so every occurrence reads as infrastructure noise and costs a judged
 * rerun. This wrapper prints the host's memory low-water mark and a verdict
 * line, so the next exit 137 is a claim about memory that a reader can check.
 *
 * It never changes what runs, and it forwards the child's exit code and signal
 * unchanged -- a killed run still fails the job.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/with-memory-watch.mjs -- <command> [args...]
 *
 * Env:
 *   PI_LENS_MEM_WATCH_INTERVAL_MS   Sampling period (default 2000).
 *   PI_LENS_MEM_WATCH_LOW_MB        Print every sample at or below this many
 *                                   MB available (default 1024).
 *   PI_LENS_MEM_WATCH_STEP_MB       Print when available memory has fallen this
 *                                   far since the last printed line
 *                                   (default 1024).
 *   PI_LENS_MEM_WATCH_SAMPLE_FILE   Path for the per-sample record (the #2042
 *                                   2026-09-15 diagnosis's "cheapest probe").
 *                                   Default: <tmpdir>/pi-lens-mem-watch-
 *                                   samples.log. Appended to, one line per
 *                                   tick, never rewritten — round-2 review F2:
 *                                   an in-memory ring plus a full-file
 *                                   rewrite each tick measured 122.7 MB of
 *                                   writes over one 12-minute run and, worse,
 *                                   held only its OWN fixed window: on a run
 *                                   whose low-water mark preceded the job's
 *                                   end by more than that window, the window
 *                                   had already scrolled past it by the time
 *                                   anything read the file. `appendFileSync`
 *                                   can never lose an earlier line, and the
 *                                   CI reader step bounds what it PRINTS with
 *                                   `tail`, not what the sampler writes.

/**
 * Every line this wrapper emits goes through a BLOCKING write, never
 * `process.stdout.write` or `process.stderr.write`.
 *
 * When stdout is a pipe, Node buffers writes and flushes them asynchronously,
 * and `process.exit()` discards whatever is still queued. A reader that has
 * fallen behind — a log collector under memory pressure, which is precisely the
 * scenario this file exists for — fills the pipe, so the verdict line is queued
 * rather than written, and then thrown away microseconds later. The #2093
 * review reproduced that 3/3 with a slow reader: correct exit code, no verdict
 * line. On Linux, `fs.writeSync` blocks until the bytes reach the OS, so the
 * record survives.
 *
 * On Windows this is NOT sufficient: pipe-buffered bytes can be discarded at
 * process teardown even after `fs.writeSync` reports a complete write (the
 * #2093 verify reproduced the loss post-fix, `ok bytes=86 of 86` and no line at
 * the reader). That is a separate OS teardown behavior no write mechanism here
 * closes. The wrapper's durability guarantee is CI-grade (Linux) only.
 *
 * #3097: fd 1 is not reliably blocking, and the wrapper does not get a vote.
 * `stdio: "inherit"` hands the child the SAME open file description, and libuv
 * sets O_NONBLOCK on it as soon as the child initialises its own
 * `process.stdout` on a pipe -- after this wrapper has started, so nothing
 * clearable at startup helps. A `writeSync` to a full pipe then throws EAGAIN
 * instead of blocking, and on CI run 35067086859 that throw came out of the
 * sampler's `setInterval` callback and killed the wrapper with exit 1, under
 * exactly the reader backpressure it exists to survive. Retrying on EAGAIN is
 * what restores the blocking semantics the paragraph above describes: it
 * retries for as long as a blocking write would have waited -- indefinitely,
 * because a blocking `writeSync` to a pipe whose reader never drains never
 * returns either (probed on this same wrapper, exit=null after 3 s). A cap
 * would be strictly LESS durable than the blocking write it emulates: the
 * verdict line would be dropped in the one case #2093 exists to cover, a
 * reader that is slow rather than gone. A reader that is GONE closes the pipe,
 * which is EPIPE, not EAGAIN, and takes the degradation path below.

/**
 * #3110 round 2 review F1: routing the once-only note through `emit()`
 * inherits its UNBOUNDED EAGAIN park (the paragraph above -- correct for the
 * verdict line, which #2093 requires never drop). The note is a different
 * contract: it exists to survive a reader that is merely SLOW (#3110), not
 * one that never drains at all. With stdout dead and stderr live-but-never-
 * draining, an unbounded retry INSIDE the sampler's `setInterval` callback
 * blocks the event loop forever -- `child.on("exit")` never runs, the
 * wrapper never forwards the exit code, and CI sees a job timeout with no
 * exit status, which is worse than the dropped note #3110 fixes. Only the
 * note's own `emit()` call takes this cap (below); the verdict line and every
 * other call keep the unbounded park unconditionally.
 *
 * 400ms: generous next to the #3110 recovery shape this cap exists for (a
 * reader that resumes on a ~100ms cadence gets several chances well inside
 * it), and short next to a typical wrapped command's own runtime. Measured,
 * not guessed: with the WRAPPED COMMAND still alive, the retry loop parks
 * cleanly on EAGAIN and gives up exactly at the deadline for any cap tried
 * (500ms-2000ms, hundreds of iterations, no stall). The moment the wrapped
 * command itself has already exited while the retry is still in flight,
 * further `writeSync` calls on the fd it shared via `stdio: "inherit"` were
 * observed to stop returning EAGAIN and block outright -- a real hang no
 * `Date.now()` check between retries can preempt, reproduced 3/3 at every
 * cap from 1000ms up against a probe whose command exits at 600ms, clean 5/5
 * at every cap from 500ms down. 400ms keeps a safety margin under that
 * boundary rather than riding it.

 * and let the child's exit code stay the story.
 *
 * #3110: this used to write the note with a raw, un-retried `fs.writeSync(2,
 * ...)` in a bare catch. Fd 1 dying (EPIPE) says nothing about fd 2's health --
 * a slow reader on stderr leaves it merely FULL, which is EAGAIN, not EPIPE --
 * and a raw write there dropped the note for good (reproduced 3/3: full stderr
 * pipe + destroyed stdout -> noteCount 0, catch code EAGAIN). `emit()` already
 * retries EAGAIN until the pipe drains; routing through it here is recursion
 * safe ONLY because `writeFailureNoted` is set BEFORE calling it -- a
 * genuinely dead stderr (EPIPE from emit's own catch) re-enters this function
 * and returns immediately instead of looping. Setting the latch after the
 * call reopens the #3097 unbounded-recursion failure mode (round 2 review
