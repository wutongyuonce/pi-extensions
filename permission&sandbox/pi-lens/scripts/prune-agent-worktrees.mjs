/**
 * scripts/prune-agent-worktrees.mjs (#2435)
 *
 * Agent worktree + orphan-process hygiene. Three independent sweeps:
 *
 *  1. AGENT WORKTREES. Every `.claude/worktrees/agent-*` git worktree that is
 *     clean, whose HEAD is contained in an `origin/*` ref, and that is old
 *     enough (or explicitly named by `--only`) is removed, together with the
 *     agent-session branch it left behind. 15 such trees accumulated on one
 *     box in a single day (#2435), each with its own build output.
 *  2. MERGED-BRANCH TREES (#2631). Any OTHER registered worktree — any path,
 *     the 2026-09-06 recurrence stood under `~/Desktop/pi-lens-wt-*` — whose
 *     branch tip is an ancestor of `origin/master` AND whose checkout is
 *     clean (no tracked changes, no untracked files) is removed and its
 *     merged local branch deleted. An untracked file is a deliverable, never
 *     disposable: on 2026-09-09 a 22 KB report left untracked in a worktree
 *     was destroyed by a sweep that treated its checkout as removable, so an
 *     empty `git status --porcelain` is the only clean that qualifies, and
 *     the keep record names the first porcelain entry it protected.
 *  3. UNREGISTERED DIRECTORIES (#2538). `.claude/worktrees/agent-*` entries
 *     present on disk but absent from `git worktree list` are removed only
 *     when they hold nothing but git's own `.git` gitlink — with no index and
 *     no known branch, every other file is treated as an untracked deliverable.
 *  4. ORPHAN FIXTURES. Any `tests/fixtures/*` / `tests/support/*` helper
 *     process whose parent has exited is killed — the class that left
 *     `fake-lsp-server.mjs` running for an hour after its fixer finished and
 *     made one worktree unremovable. The fixture's own missing teardown is
 *     #2436; this is the machine-level net under it, not the fix.
 *
 *  2 and 3 are capped per run with `--max` (default 10); what the cap skips
 *  is printed. All the decision logic lives in scripts/lib/worktree-hygiene.mjs
 *  and is pure (tables in, verdicts out). This file owns only the I/O: `git`
 *  invocations, the platform process listing, `process.kill`, and the ledger
 *  write. Anything that could destroy work is therefore unit-testable
 *  WITHOUT this file running.
 *
 * Safety rails (see the library header for the full contract):
 *   - never a dirty tree; never an unpushed tree — no flag overrides either;
 *   - never a tree younger than --min-age, and never one whose git lock
 *     names a live pid, UNLESS --only names it;
 *   - never this process, and never any ancestor of it;
 *   - never a fixture helper whose parent is still alive, and never one whose
 *     parent pid is unreadable — unanswered is keep, not kill;
 *   - kills are always by pid after a command-line/cwd match, never
 *     `taskkill`-by-name.
 *
 * A worktree's AGE is read only from signals this sweep does not itself
 * write — see `WORKTREE_ACTIVITY_SIGNALS` in the library. Reading the git
 * index made every tree `age 0ms` the moment the dirty rail looked at it, and
 * the sweep removed nothing at all for its whole first life.
 *
 * WHO REMOVES WHAT (see resolveHookPolicy):
 *   `--hook subagent-stop` REAPS the tree of the agent that just stopped,
 *   derived from the payload's `agent_id`. This reverses PR #2438's review S1
 *   (maintainer decision, 2026-09-02). S1 forbade removal here because
 *   resume-by-SendMessage lands after the hook fires; the cost was #2486 --
 *   the registered line passes no `--only`, so it removed nothing, only
 *   SessionStart's one-tree-per-run cap drained anything, and N stale trees
 *   needed N sessions. Ten accumulated in one afternoon.
 *   THE TRADE-OFF: an agent resumed by SendMessage after its tree was reaped
 *   must recreate the checkout. Its BRANCH survives (branches are deleted only
 *   for a removal that succeeded, and only the ref that removal orphaned), so
 *   nothing committed is lost -- only the working copy. `--keep-agent-tree`,
 *   or PILENS_HYGIENE_KEEP_AGENT_TREES=1, turns the removal off and leaves the
 *   scoped orphan sweep. Merge-train worktrees are not `agent-*` trees, so
 *   `isAgentWorktreePath` never selects them either way.
 *   `--hook subagent-stop --only <tree>` is the MANUAL form: a caller at a
 *   terminal naming trees by hand, with the manual budget.
 *   Removal belongs otherwise to `--hook session-start` (default --min-age,
 *   clean + pushed rails, never --only, at most ONE tree per run) and to a
 *   manual `npm run hygiene` (same rails, --min-age overridable, uncapped).
 *
 * REMOVAL IS INDEPENDENT OF THE PROCESS SCAN (#2486). The scan feeds two
 * things -- the orphan-fixture sweep and the "kill what is holding this tree"
 * step -- and both degrade to "do nothing" when the listing fails. Neither
 * may cancel a removal: `git worktree remove --force --force` does not need
 * the table, and a hygiene.log with a scan-degraded line and no removal line
 * is exactly what #2486 reported.
 *
 * EVERY INVOCATION WRITES A LEDGER LINE (#2486). `formatRunRecord` emits one
 * `hygiene.run` record on every exit path, `fired` or `skipped` with a reason
 * from RUN_SKIP_REASONS. Both hooks run `--quiet` and Claude Code discards
 * their stderr, so before this an early return was indistinguishable from a
 * hook that never fired at all.
 *
 * THE SubagentStop PAYLOAD is Claude Code's contract, read from the shipped
 * binary (~/.local/share/claude/versions/2.1.258) rather than assumed:
 *   { session_id, transcript_path, cwd, prompt_id?, permission_mode?,
 *     agent_id?, agent_type?, ... } and, for this event,
 *   { hook_event_name: "SubagentStop", stop_hook_active, agent_id,
 *     agent_transcript_path, agent_type, last_assistant_message?, ... }
 * `agent_id` is REQUIRED on SubagentStop, and Claude Code names a managed
 * agent worktree "agent-" + agentId (the shipped bundle's
 * `function t8n(e){return "agent-"+e}`, with ids shaped /^a[0-9a-f]{16}$/ or
 * /^a[0-9a-f]{7}$/ per its own validator). There is no
 * worktree-path field on the event, so the id -> path mapping stays a
 * verified naming convention: the derived path is checked on disk before it
 * is acted on. Most subagents are NOT worktree-isolated, so a missing
 * directory is the ORDINARY case and is now reported as such rather than as
 * "no usable agent_id".
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/prune-agent-worktrees.mjs [--dry-run] [--min-age 30m]
 *        [--only <path>]... [--json] [--quiet]
 *   node scripts/prune-agent-worktrees.mjs --hook subagent-stop
 *        [--keep-agent-tree]   (reads the hook JSON payload on stdin, derives
 *        the stopped agent's worktree from `agent_id`, scopes the orphan
 *        sweep to it, and removes it unless --keep-agent-tree)
 *   node scripts/prune-agent-worktrees.mjs --hook session-start
 *
 * Exit code is ALWAYS 0. This is a hygiene sweep wired to Claude Code hooks
 * (`.claude/settings.json`); a hygiene failure must never fail a session.
 * Errors are printed and recorded in the ledger instead.
 *
 * Ledger: `<PILENS_DATA_DIR | PI_LENS_HOME | ~/.pi-lens>/hygiene.log`, JSONL,
 * bounded to the newest DEFAULT_LOG_MAX_LINES records with a truncated
 * command field (an append-only log with an unbounded field is the classic
 * "bounded on one axis, unbounded on another" leak this repo keeps finding).

                        Overrides --min-age and the live-lock rail for the

                        tree and takes the manual budget.
  --keep-agent-tree     --hook subagent-stop only: reap orphaned fixture
                        helpers under the stopped agent's tree but LEAVE the
                        tree itself. For operators who resume agents by

                        Also settable with PILENS_HYGIENE_KEEP_AGENT_TREES=1.
  --hook <event>        subagent-stop | session-start. Reads the hook JSON
                        payload on stdin. subagent-stop derives the stopped
                        agent's worktree from the payload's agent_id, reaps
                        orphaned test-fixture helpers under it, and REMOVES
