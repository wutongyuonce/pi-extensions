/**
 * Mechanically re-keys `EXEMPT_SITES` in
 * `tests/config/hook-await-bounds.test.ts` after a merge shifts lines near a
 * flagged hook-await or hand-rolled-race site (#2530 round 3 F6).
 *
 * Every key in that table is content-derived (`stableOccurrenceKey` plus a
 * two-line neighbourhood, see `tests/support/hook-await-scan.ts`), which
 * means a line inserted immediately above or below a flagged occurrence
 * re-keys it even though the occurrence itself did not move or change. That
 * is by design (#2475 — content keys, never line numbers), but it means an
 * unrelated PR's merge can turn a handful of the 187+ entries stale without
 * touching this file at all: the guard test then fails, printing the NEW key
 * for each now-unaccounted occurrence, and someone has to paste 1-3 keys in
 * by hand per touched site. This script does that mechanically instead,
 * for the WHOLE table at once, and REFUSES to touch anything it cannot
 * match with certainty.
 *
 * ## How matching works, and why it does not need git history
 *
 * Every key already carries its own file, enclosing-symbol identity (where
 * the detector found one) and OWN-LINE content hash in plain text, all
 * together ahead of the final `~context` suffix: `rel#symbol:hash~context`
 * or `rel#hash~context` (`race:` on hand-rolled-race keys). Call everything
 * before the last `~` a key's HEAD. A line-shifting edit near a flagged site
 * changes only the two neighbour lines the `~context` suffix hashes — the
 * head is untouched, because the flagged line itself did not change. So this
 * script:
 *
 * 1. Parses every key straight out of `EXEMPT_SITES`'s source text, in
 *    declaration order.
 * 2. Runs the SAME detector `tests/config/hook-await-bounds.test.ts` uses
 *    (imported from `tests/support/hook-await-scan.mjs` — the shared module
 *    that exists specifically so this script and the guard test can never
 *    drift apart) against the CURRENT tree, producing the live occurrence
 *    list.
 * 3. Groups both the table's old keys and the live occurrences by HEAD —
 *    everything before the final `~context` (not by file/symbol identity
 *    alone — #2530 round 4 F1). Within one head's bucket every candidate is
 *    the SAME flagged line: same file, same symbol, same content hash.
 *    An old key already present verbatim among the live occurrences needs
 *    no rewrite. Whatever is left in the bucket is paired by position only
 *    when the leftover counts match — safe here because position can only
 *    decide which physically identical duplicate a reason/owner attaches
 *    to, never whether two DIFFERENT lines are treated as the same site.
 * 4. Refuses to touch any old key whose bucket does not resolve that way:
 *    zero live occurrences share its head (the line was fixed, deleted, or
 *    its content genuinely changed), or a leftover surplus/shortfall (an
 *    ambiguous count). Each such key is printed with whatever live
 *    occurrences DO share its head, if any, so a human can decide by hand.
 *
 * This is deliberately NOT a count-matched, order-zipped pairing within a
 * file/symbol group (the round-3 design). That grouping could not tell a
 * genuine line shift apart from one flagged line being swapped for an
 * unrelated new one in the same function while the OLD line was fixed —
 * both leave the group's old-count equal to its new-count, so an
 * order-based zip silently carries the OLD key's exemption reason onto the
 * NEW, unrelated await (reviewer probe, #2530 round 4 F1: replacing one
 * flagged await with a brand-new unbounded await in the same `rel#symbol`
 * kept the group's count equal and the old rewrite laundered the old
 * exemption onto the new site). Matching on the full head — hash included —
 * cannot do that: the replaced line's hash and the new line's hash differ,
 * so neither has a clean 1:1 partner and both are refused.
 *
 * A vitest test file cannot be `import()`ed by a bare `node` process (its
 * top-level `describe()`/`it()` calls need a running vitest worker), which
 * is exactly why the detector lives in `tests/support/hook-await-scan.ts`
 * and not in the test file itself.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/rekey-hook-await-exemptions.mjs            # report only
 *   node scripts/rekey-hook-await-exemptions.mjs --write    # rewrite the file

 * Pure matching between the table's OLD keys (declaration order) and the

 * synthetic key lists instead of the real tree.
 *
 * Within one head's bucket (same file, same symbol, same flagged-line
 * content hash — everything a laundered replacement would NOT share, see
 * the module doc), matching happens in two passes:
 *
 * 1. An old key whose full text (head AND context) still appears verbatim
 *    among the live occurrences needs no rewrite at all — paired off first
 *    and dropped from further consideration. This is what keeps a
 *    legitimate duplicate (the same statement flagged several times in one
 *    function, distinguished only by which neighbour lines its context
 *    hashes) from being reported as ambiguous when nothing about it moved.
 * 2. Whatever is left in the bucket is paired by position only when the
 *    counts still match — safe here specifically because every candidate in
 *    a head bucket is provably the SAME flagged line (file, symbol, and
 *    content hash all equal); the only thing position decides is which
 *    physically identical occurrence a cosmetic `reason`/`owner` attaches
 *    to, never whether two DIFFERENT lines get treated as the same site.
 *
 * A head where the leftover counts do not match is `unresolved`, carrying
 * whatever live occurrences (zero, some, or a surplus) remain in its
 * bucket, so a human sees the actual current source line(s) rather than a
 * bare key.
