/**
 * scripts/ci-verdict.mjs (#2539): ONE REST read of EVERY check-run on an
 * EXACT head SHA, replacing the ad hoc `gh api` filters the fixer/reviewer
 * playbooks were hand-writing and the tail of `gh pr checks`, which hid a
 * failed Unit tests behind a passing Lint (#2527 review round 2 merge-
 * blocked on exactly that). Sibling to scripts/check-pr-body.mjs: a pure
 * verdict function over the check-runs JSON, exported for tests, and a thin
 * `gh` CLI shell around it -- no GITHUB_TOKEN/GITHUB_API_URL plumbing, just
 * `gh` on PATH (the issue's acceptance criterion).
 *
 * #2609: originally this script only ever looked at the fixed
 * `REQUIRED_CHECKS` pair (`Unit tests`, `Lint & type-check`), so a red
 * "Production install build" or "Install test" job on PR #2588's head
 * e32d814e never entered the computation at all -- exit 0, "both required
 * checks concluded success", while a real code defect (a widened peer range
 * containing spaces, word-split by `read -ra`) sat red. Every check-run
 * GitHub reports on the head is now a row, and every row GATES unless it is
 * on the advisory allowlist (`scripts/lib/ci-checks.mjs`'s
 * `isAdvisoryCheck` -- the SAME list #2185's real merge-train gate already
 * uses). `run()` also attempts a LIVE read of `master`'s branch-protection
 * required-status-check names via `gh api`, and treats those names as
 * gating unconditionally (never excusable by the static advisory allowlist)
 * when that read succeeds; when it does not (no permission, no ruleset,
 * transport error), the constant `REQUIRED_CHECKS` pair is the fallback --
 * either way, "every check-run not on the advisory allowlist gates" holds.
 *
 * #2618 fix-round-2: a gating row's conclusion is judged differently
 * depending on whether it is one of those confirmed-required names or
 * merely discovered. A REQUIRED row must reach a literal "success" --
 * ANYTHING else (skipped, neutral, or a real failure) is non-zero, while a
 * latest cancellation gets the explicit rerun-pending verdict below, because
 * a required check that skipped or was cancelled is stale or interrupted
 * evidence, never proof of a pass (round 1's bug: it exempted skipped/neutral on EVERY gating row, so a required `Unit tests` skipped by
 * a failed `needs:` dependency read as a clean pass). A DISCOVERED row's
 * "skipped"/"neutral" conclusion is a genuine non-failure (a job-level
 * `if:` that evaluated false -- see computeVerdict's own doc comment), and
 * its "cancelled" conclusion is UNCERTAIN rather than failing: this repo's
 * `cancel-in-progress: true` (ci.yml:15-16) leaves a stale cancelled row as
 * the only entry for its name for several minutes before a replacement
 * posts, and reading that window as a hard failure is a false positive on a
 * check still in flight, not one that failed.
 *
 *   node scripts/ci-verdict.mjs <pr-number|sha> [--wait <seconds>]
 *
 * Exit codes:
 *   0  -- every gating check-run concluded "success", or (discovered rows
 *         only) a non-blocking terminal conclusion: "skipped"/"neutral"
 *   1  -- a gating check-run completed with a conclusion that fails it: any
 *         non-"success" conclusion on a REQUIRED row, or (on a discovered
 *         row) a blocking one -- failure/timed_out/action_required/stale/
 *         startup_failure; a latest cancelled row is pending with a rerun hint
 *   2  -- the PR's head is genuinely merge-conflicted (`gh pr view --json
 *         mergeable` reads "CONFLICTING"), regardless of whether the required
 *         checks are present or absent in check-runs (round 3, F1): a
 *         merge-conflicted PR can't build its merge-ref, so its real gates
 *         are skipped, not failed (AGENTS.md recurring-defect shape 11) --
 *         and even when checks ARE present and green, that's stale evidence
 *         from before the head turned conflicting, not proof the PR can
 *         merge. Exit 2 is PR-only: a bare-SHA target carries no `mergeable`
 *         (`null`, never `"CONFLICTING"`) and can never produce DIRTY -- an
 *         absent check there reads as pending (3) instead, see below. An
 *         absent check on a PR that is NOT conflicting also reads as pending
 *         (3) -- see "Absent is not automatically DIRTY" below -- since the
 *         common cause is CI not yet registered (a fresh push), not a
 *         conflict.
 *   3  -- either required check is still queued/in_progress, OR is absent but
 *         not confirmed merge-conflicted (see exit 2), OR the check-runs
 *         required checks are absent and the head is not confirmed conflicting
 *   64 -- usage error (no target given) -- sysexits EX_USAGE, never confused
 *         with a verdict code
 *   70 -- transport/unexpected error (gh not on PATH, a `gh` call timed out
 *         or failed, malformed JSON, ...) -- sysexits EX_SOFTWARE, never
 *         confused with exit 1 ("CI failed"): a script that could not even
 *         ask GitHub is not the same fact as GitHub answering "red"
 *
 * Absent is not automatically DIRTY (#2539 round 2, F1): the common cause of
 * an absent required check is CI not yet registered on a fresh push or a
 * push that just landed (partial registration), not a merge conflict.
 * Reading absent as unconditional DIRTY meant `--wait` could never bridge
 * that registration delay -- `pollVerdict` breaks the loop on ANY
 * non-pending verdict, so a same-second-as-push read would permanently
 * misreport a perfectly healthy PR as merge-conflicted. For a PR-number
 * target, this script now also reads `mergeable` from the same `gh pr view`
 * call that already resolves the head SHA, and only reports DIRTY when
 * `mergeable === "CONFLICTING"`. A bare-SHA target carries no PR context at
 * all, so an absent check there is always reported as pending, with a note.
 *
 * DIRTY is not gated on absence either (#2539 round 3, F1): round 2 still
 * required `anyAbsent && mergeable === "CONFLICTING"`, so the DOMINANT DIRTY
 * shape -- a head that went green, then turned conflicted afterward, same
 * head SHA, old green check-runs still attached -- read as a pass (exit 0,
 * "both required checks concluded success") instead of DIRTY. A live probe
 * on #2552 confirmed it: present-and-green checks plus `mergeable ===
 * "CONFLICTING"` exited 0. `computeVerdict` now checks `mergeable ===
 * "CONFLICTING"` on its own, independent of whether any row is present --
 * the verdict record always carries `mergeState` (`mergeable ?? "n/a"`) and
 * `rows`, and `run()` always prints the merge state line so a reviewer never
 * has to infer it from `reason` text.
 *
 * #2664: filed against a live `2654` read that printed the exact reason text
 * below and reported exit 0 for it. Reproduced directly against this
 * function (both required rows absent, `mergeable: "MERGEABLE"`) and via the
 * full `run()` CLI path with a mocked `ghExec`: both already returned
 * `EXIT_PENDING` (3), matching test A1 in tests/scripts/ci-verdict.test.ts,
 * which has asserted exactly this since #2539 round 2 -- the reported exit 0
 * does not reproduce on any commit in this file's history, including the
 * original #2609 introduction of the discovered-rows table. The one real gap
 * was the optional hint the issue asked for: the reason text below now ends
 * with a CONDITIONAL "if the base was retargeted..." clause for the
 * mergeable-known absent case, since a base retarget after a PR opens
 * (ci.yml has no `edited` trigger) is the concrete scenario #2664 named. Not
 * phrased as a bare imperative (verify round 1, F5): an absent-check verdict
 * is also the ROUTINE outcome of a fresh push, where CI simply has not
 * registered yet (this function's own #2539 round 2 doc comment above) --
 * that is the FAR more common case, so an unconditional "push a commit"
 * directive would tell the common case's reader to push ANOTHER commit and
 * restart all of CI for no reason. There is no cheap way for a one-shot `gh`
 * read to know whether the base actually changed since the PR opened (this
 * script keeps no state between runs, by design), so the hint stays
 * conditional prose rather than a fact this read can confirm.
 *
 * `--wait <seconds>` polls at a fixed, non-configurable >=30s interval, for
 * the orchestrator only -- never in a tight loop. The requested budget is
 * clamped to a hard cap so a large ask can't itself become the next
 * 5000/hr-API-budget incident (12 agents polling `gh pr checks --watch` in
 * one day, #2539's own motivating history) plus the fabricated-CI-quote and
 * hidden-Unit-tests-failure incidents this script exists to replace.
 *
 * Every `gh` call carries an explicit `timeout` (#2539 round 2, F4): a probe
 * found a hung `gh` process blocks `execFileSync` for as long as the process
 * hangs, with NO relationship to `--wait`'s own budget -- a 30s `--wait`
 * budget was blocked 51s past its cap by one unbounded call. Each call's
 * timeout is derived from the remaining `--wait` budget -- `resolveRepository`
 * and `resolveHeadSha` from the full clamped budget before polling starts,
 * each check-runs read from what's left when it fires -- or a flat 60s
 * default for a one-shot read (no `--wait`).
 *
 * That derivation has a floor (#2539 round 3, F2): clamping straight to the
 * literal remaining budget, with no floor, meant a hang could NOT blow past
 * the cap -- but a healthy call could get killed by its OWN timeout instead.
 * A probe on `--wait 31` derived a 50ms timeout for the last poll and killed
 * a healthy ~950ms `gh` call, misreporting a green head as exit 70
 * (transport failure). A budget that had already reached its deadline
 * (`remainingMs <= 0`) fell through to the opposite failure: the full 60s
 * default, on the very call meant to end the wait, which could itself blow
 * the `--wait` budget it was derived from. `resolveGhTimeoutMs` now floors
 * every derived timeout at `MIN_GH_TIMEOUT_MS` -- a hang still can't blow far
 * past the hard cap (the floor is a small fraction of it), and a healthy
 * call near the end of a small budget still gets a fighting chance.

 * build" or "Install test" job on PR #2588's head e32d814e never appeared at
 * all -- `run()` reported "both required checks concluded success" while a
 * real code defect sat red. `rows` now also carries one row for every OTHER
 * check-run name GitHub reports on the head (`discoveredRows` below,
 * appended after the required rows, sorted by name for a deterministic
 * table). `requiredChecks` NAMES are still the only ones that can be
 * reported ABSENT (a name not yet in `byName` at all just isn't a row --
 * there is no fixed manifest of what a PR "should" run, unlike the
 * always-eventually-present required pair).
 *
 * Every row carries `gating`: `!isAdvisoryCheck(row.name)`, OR'd with
 * membership in `requiredChecks` itself. The OR matters only when
 * `requiredChecks` came from a live branch-protection read (`run()` passes
 * that instead of the constant default when `gh api .../protection` is
 * readable) and GitHub's own required-check list names something this
 * script's static `ADVISORY_CHECKS`/`ADVISORY_SUFFIX` allowlist would
 * otherwise excuse -- a live "required by GitHub" signal always overrides a
 * static "advisory" guess (AGENTS.md shape 38: the cheapest evasion is
 * quietly adding a real gate to the advisory list; this override is the
 * belt-and-suspenders check that catches it even if it happens).
 *
 * A NON-gating row (advisory) is excluded from both the FAILURE and PENDING
 * checks below regardless of its own status/conclusion -- an advisory lane
 * still red or still running must never hold up or fail the verdict.
 *
 * `isBlockingConclusion` (scripts/lib/ci-checks.mjs), not a bare `!==
 * "success"` comparison, decides whether a COMPLETED gating row is a
 * failure: "skipped" and "neutral" are terminal-but-not-failing conclusions,
 * and NOT hypothetical here -- this repository's own
 * `record-post-merge-validation` job (defined in both ci.yml and lint.yml)
 * carries a job-level `if: ... event_name == 'repository_dispatch'` and
 * reports "skipped" on every ordinary pull_request run (confirmed live on
 * PR #2588, 2026-09-06 -- two "Record post-merge validation" rows, both
 * "skipping" in `gh pr checks`). Reading `!== "success"` as failure the way
 * the pre-#2609 script did would have turned that routine skip into a
