/**
 * Release-QA runner (#2606) — witness the feature × modality matrix against a
 * REAL pi before a tag is cut.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * #2587: the four shipped skills were suspected of never registering for four
 * releases because no check ever asked a real pi what it loaded. The unit suite
 * and the nightly smokes are per-seam; nothing composed them into a release
 * verdict with COUNTED coverage, so a missing row read as absence rather than
 * arithmetic. This runner is that composition.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES
 *   1. Reads `docs/release-qa-baseline.md` — the matrix is the DOCUMENT, not a
 *      copy of it in here. Every row id there must have a probe below and vice
 *      versa (`tests/scripts/release-qa.test.ts` enforces the tie).
 *   2. Exports the COMMITTED tree (`git archive HEAD`) into the scratch root and
 *      packs THERE — or takes `--from npm:pi-lens@X` to QA a published release
 *      instead — then installs the tarball into a SCRATCH project. The export
 *      matters: `npm pack` runs our own `prepack` (which rewrites
 *      `package.json` + `package-lock.json`, restored only by `postpack`, with
 *      no signal trap) and `prepare` (rebuilds `dist/`, downloads grammars,
 *      reinstalls git hooks), and none of that may happen in the live checkout.
 *      A dirty checkout is REFUSED rather than silently packed as its last
 *      commit.
 *   3. Installs that package into a scratch `pi`. EVERY child process — `pi`,
 *      the MCP server, `node`, and `npm` — runs under `scratchEnv()`, which
 *      pins `HOME`, `USERPROFILE`, `PI_LENS_HOME`, `PILENS_DATA_DIR`,
 *      `PI_LENS_INSTALL_LOG` and `npm_config_cache` inside the scratch root
 *      (AGENTS.md probe hygiene, #2506). `PI_LENS_INSTALL_LOG` is listed
 *      separately for a reason: it explicitly selects the warm-loader log
 *      file, while `PI_LENS_HOME` selects its fallback directory.
 *   4. Drives each row's entry point — the command or RPC a USER path takes,
 *      never a raw internal function — and writes `release-qa-report.md` plus
 *      one witness file per row under `release-qa-evidence/`.
 *
 * OUTCOMES
 * Every discovered row ends PASS / FAIL(cause) / UNTESTED(reason) /
 * SKIPPED(reason), and the four partition the discovered set — the report
 * asserts `discovered = pass + fail + untested + skipped`. An async row that
 * does not reach a terminal state before its polling cap expires UNTESTED,
 * never PASS.
 *
 * Two verdicts issue NO ship line at all:
 *   - **BLOCKED** — `pi` itself did not boot, probed BEFORE anything is
 *     installed. Nothing about the candidate was measured. A candidate that
 *     will not install or activate while pi boots fine is DO-NOT-SHIP, not
 *     BLOCKED: that is a result, not an untestable state.
 *   - **INCONCLUSIVE** — pi booted, but not one row produced a witness. "No
 *     row disagreed" is not evidence, so it never reads as ship-with-caveats.
 *
 * Exit codes: 0 ship · 1 do not ship · 2 ship with caveats (the EXPECTED
 * working-tree verdict — the git-install row is SKIPPED without `--git-ref`) ·
 * 3 BLOCKED or INCONCLUSIVE · 4 usage/self-check error.
 *
 * USAGE
 *   node scripts/release-qa.mjs [options]
 *     --pi <path>          pi binary to drive (default: `pi` on PATH)
 *     --from <source>      `tree` (default: npm pack this repo) or
 *                          `npm:pi-lens@<version>` to QA a published release
 *     --baseline <path>    default docs/release-qa-baseline.md
 *     --out <dir>          where the report + evidence land (default: cwd)
 *     --poll-cap-ms <n>    cap for polled async rows (default 120000)
 *     --git-ref <ref>      enable the git-install row against this pushed ref
 *     --keep               leave the scratch root on disk
 *     --scratch-root <dir> use this directory as the scratch root instead of
 *                          a fresh mkdtemp dir (created when missing; a
 *                          pre-existing directory is never removed on exit)
 *
 * Node-only, no new dependency. Every spawn is shell-free (execFile/spawn with
 * an argv array) per AGENTS.md.
