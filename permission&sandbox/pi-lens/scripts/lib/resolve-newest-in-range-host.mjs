// Pure helpers behind scripts/resolve-newest-in-range-host.mjs (#2613) — kept
// side-effect-free (no fs/child_process/npm) so the semver-selection logic is
// unit-testable without a live npm registry, mirroring
// scripts/lib/drift-issue.mjs's own testing pattern (that file tests the
// issue-body/lookup logic, not the workflow step that shells out to `gh`;
// this tests the version-selection logic, not the script that shells out to
// `npm view`).
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS (#2590 recurrence, #2613)
// install-smoke.yml's PR-gating lanes install the pinned floor host AND the
// newest pi-coding-agent version this repo's declared peerDependencies range
// admits, so a peer-range change (like #2588) is exercised on the exact host
// it newly admits, before it ships. Reading the range straight out of
// package.json (rather than duplicating it as a separate workflow input)
// keeps the install lane and the declared range in agreement BY
// CONSTRUCTION — a future range edit changes what this resolves on its very
// next run, no second edit required.
//
// REVIEW S1 (#2613 round 2): `peerDependencies["@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent"]`
// is `"*"` today — an unbounded peer range would make "newest in range"
// silently equal "@latest" on a BLOCKING PR lane, exactly the "always
// latest" shape the maintainer routed to the ADVISORY nightly instead. A
// repo-owned `PI_HOST_SUPPORTED_RANGE` (workflow env, alongside the floor
// pin) is intersected with the declared peer range so the wildcard case
// stays bounded by construction; `pickNewestInRange` now takes a LIST of
// ranges (AND semantics: a candidate must satisfy every one).
