/**
 * scripts/lib/ci-checks.mjs (#2539 round 2, F2): the ONE required-checks name
 * list and the ONE fail-closed "latest check-run per name" resolver, shared
 * by every consumer that reads GitHub check-runs for this repo's two gating
 * checks -- merge-train-warden.mjs (GraphQL rollup: `startedAt`, UPPERCASE
 * `status`/`conclusion`), merge-train-lane.mjs (via the warden today, moved
 * to import this module directly in this round), and ci-verdict.mjs (REST
 * `commits/<sha>/check-runs`: `started_at`, lowercase `status`/`conclusion`).
 *
 * Before this round, ci-verdict.mjs hand-rolled its own `latestRunNamed`
 * with an `id`-as-tiebreak policy that is NOT fail-closed (a superseded
 * SUCCESS with the higher id could win a tie over an unresolved duplicate),
 * while merge-train-warden.mjs already carried the correct policy. Two
 * required-check name lists and two different tie policies for the same
 * real-world duplicate-check-run shape (a rerun, or the classify-ci-failure
 * auto-rerun, #2103) is the single-source-of-truth defect this module fixes.
