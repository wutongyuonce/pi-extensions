// Pure helpers behind scripts/notify-install-smoke-drift.mjs (#2613 review
// S2/T3, then round-2 review F1) — kept side-effect-free (no fs/child_process/
// gh) so the body/lookup logic is unit-testable without a live `gh` CLI,
// mirroring scripts/lib/drift-issue.mjs's own testing pattern for the SAME
// reason (that file: nightly `tool-smoke` silentOnClean drift; this file:
// nightly `install-smoke` host-latest install drift). `findDriftTrackingIssue`
// from drift-issue.mjs is reused directly (its title parameter was
// generalized for this second consumer) rather than a second title-matching
// copy. drift-issue.mjs's OWN close condition is a computed finding COUNT
// (`warnings.length === 0`), not this file's shape — it does not share F1.
//
// F1 (round 2): a real GitHub Actions `steps.<id>.outcome` has FOUR values —
// "success" | "failure" | "cancelled" | "skipped" — not two. The original
// `hasDrift` (some step "failure") was correct for FILING, but the caller
// used "not hasDrift" as the CLOSE condition, so a run with every step
// "cancelled" (concurrency's `cancel-in-progress` interrupting a nightly
// mid-run when a dispatch lands on the same ref) or "skipped" (a step's own
// `if:` never became true) had no "failure" anywhere and closed a live
// tracker as "self-resolved" — it never actually installed anything.
// `isCleanRun` (EVERY step "success") is the only correct close condition; a
// run that is neither drifting nor clean (some cancelled/skipped, nothing
// failed) takes NO action at all.
