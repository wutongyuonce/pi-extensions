/**
 * scripts/lib/worktree-hygiene.mjs (#2435)
 *
 * PURE decision logic for scripts/prune-agent-worktrees.mjs: which agent
 * worktrees may be removed, which processes may be killed, and how the kill
 * ledger stays bounded. Split from the CLI (which owns `git worktree list`,
 * the Windows CIM / POSIX `ps` process listing, and the actual
 * `process.kill`) for the same reason scripts/lib/process-scan.mjs was split
 * from compat-smoke-behavioral.mjs: the risky part is the DECISION, and a
 * decision is only testable if it is a function of a table rather than of
 * the machine. Every test in tests/scripts/worktree-hygiene.test.ts feeds a
 * synthetic worktree/process table here; nothing in this file can kill or
 * delete anything.
 *
 * Safety posture -- the rails are the contract (#2435 acceptance criteria):
 *   - A DIRTY worktree is never removed. No flag overrides this.
 *   - A worktree whose HEAD is not contained in any `origin/*` ref is never
 *     removed (unpushed work is unrecoverable once the tree is gone). No
 *     flag overrides this.
 *   - A worktree younger than `minAgeMs` is kept, and a worktree whose git
 *     lock record names a LIVE pid is kept -- both overridable ONLY by
 *     `--only`, which is how the SubagentStop hook names the one tree whose
 *     agent just finished. `--only` never overrides dirty/unpushed.
 *   - Kills are by pid, only for processes matched to a removable worktree
 *     path or to a `tests/fixtures/*` / `tests/support/*` helper, and never
 *     for this process or any of its ancestors.
 *   - A fixture helper whose PARENT IS STILL ALIVE is never killed -- that is
 *     a running test, not a leak.
 *
 * On the git lock record: Claude Code locks each agent worktree with a
 * reason like `claude agent agent-<id> (pid <pid>)`, where the pid is the
 * TOP-LEVEL Claude Code process shared by every agent in that session -- not
 * the individual agent. So a live lock pid means "this Claude Code session
 * is still running", which is the right default keep signal for a
 * SessionStart sweep (it protects sibling agents' trees) and exactly the
 * wrong one for SubagentStop (the session is alive by definition there).
 * Hence: keep by default, `--only` overrides.

 *
 * PR #2438 review round 3 (F1) -- the defect that made the whole sweep inert.
 * `worktreeActivityMs` took the max over four signals, two of which the
 * sweep's OWN inspection writes: `git status --porcelain` (how `isDirty`
 * answers the dirty rail) rewrites `<admin>/index` and therefore bumps both
 * that file and the admin DIRECTORY holding it. Every candidate came back
 * `age 0ms`, `too-young` rejected all of them, and nothing was ever removed.
 * Measured on the #2435 box (git 2.55.0.windows.3) with a throwaway worktree
 * whose four signals were all backdated to now-3h:
 *
 *   signal           before git status   after git status
 *   checkout dir     age 10800s          age 10800s   unchanged
 *   adminDir         age 10800s          age     0s   BUMPED
 *   adminDir/HEAD    age 10800s          age 10800s   unchanged
 *   adminDir/index   age 10800s          age     0s   BUMPED
 *
 * So the admissible set is the two proven-unchanged signals plus the HEAD
 * reflog's last ENTRY timestamp: git appends to `<admin>/logs/HEAD` only
 * when HEAD actually moves (checkout, commit, reset), and the same probe
 * confirmed `git status --porcelain` changes neither its size nor its mtime.
 * The reflog is the one signal that survives a tool copying or re-touching
 * the checkout directory, which is why it is worth reading a file for.

 * a hook that fired and had nothing to reap: both read `fired, removed: 0`. It
