/**
 * Install self-test — verifies pi-lens's runtime dependency graph actually
 * resolves *as installed*, independent of the host model or auth.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * Issues #285 (pnpm symlink store) and #335 (nested npm install) reported
 * `ResolveMessage: Cannot find package '<dep>' from ...` — pi-lens failing to
 * load because a third-party RUNTIME dep was unreachable under a non-default
 * package-manager layout. (The original report named `typescript`; it's since a
 * devDependency — #402 — so the probe now covers the remaining runtime deps.)
 * Those did not reproduce on current bun/pi, but the failure class is real and
 * silent in normal dev (a flat `node_modules` always resolves). This probe makes
 * it loud and CI-catchable.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES
 * Force-imports the modules whose TOP-LEVEL bare imports are the documented
 * failure points, plus the bare specifiers directly, and checks the two
 * build-script-provided assets (ast-grep CLI binary + tree-sitter grammars)
 * that pnpm/bun skip by default. It also resolves the `pi.skills` manifest
 * entries the way pi does, from the installed package root (#2587). It runs no
 * model and needs no credentials.
 *
 * WHAT IT NO LONGER COVERS (#1926)
 * pi supplies `typebox` and `@earendil-works/pi-tui` from its own runtime, so
 * they are optional peers and no install vendors them. This probe is not pi, so
 * those specifiers cannot resolve here, and `dist/index.js` throws on the FIRST
 * one it imports. A host-provided miss is therefore recorded as EXPECTED rather
 * than failed. The cost is real and stated plainly: evaluation stops there, so
 * the entry probe no longer proves the whole bundled graph resolves, which is
 * what #285 and #335 asked it to prove. Any OTHER unresolved specifier still
 * fails hard, and the per-module probes below (file-utils, complexity-client,
 * bootstrap) still cover that graph directly. The surviving POSITIVE proof that
 * the entry loads in full is the install-smoke `pi-load` job: it installs pi,
 * installs pi-lens through pi, and confirms over RPC that pi-lens registered
 * its commands.
 *
 * USAGE
 *   bun  scripts/install-selftest.mjs     # faithful: pi's runtime is bun
 *   node scripts/install-selftest.mjs     # also works
 * Exit 0 = all critical checks passed; non-zero = at least one failed.
 * `--allow-soft` downgrades the build-script-asset checks (ast-grep/grammars)
 * to warnings, so a pure *resolution* regression is still a hard failure.
