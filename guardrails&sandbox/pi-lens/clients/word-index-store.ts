/**
 * Packed backing store for the word index's inverted postings (#2069).
 *
 * The index used to hold one boxed `{ file: string; line: number }` object per
 * (token, file, line) posting. On this repository's own 2,622-document corpus
 * that is 2.22 million objects for 17.9 MB of source: a V8 object header, a
 * pointer into the file table, and a boxed number, to carry eight bytes of
 * information. Measured resident cost was 186.6 MB, or 88.1 bytes per entry.
 *
 * The information content is a pair of small integers, and the serializer has
 * always known it: `SerializedWordIndex.postings` is
 * `[token, [fileIdx, line, fileIdx, line, …]]`. This module makes the in-memory
 * form match the wire form. {@link WordPostingList} stores those pairs in an
 * `Int32Array` — two 32-bit lanes, {@link WORD_POSTING_ENTRY_BYTES} bytes per
 * entry, no per-entry object — and {@link WordIndexFileTable} owns the dense
 * file-id space the `fileIdx` lane refers to.
 *
 * The file table is deliberately ONE structure rather than a key→path map plus
 * a parallel id list: `ids` and `paths` are two views of a single interning
 * decision, so there is nothing to keep in sync by hand. It supersedes the
 * `Map<string, string>` interning table added in #2082 and keeps that fix's
 * invariant in a stronger form — posting removal now compares an integer id
 * instead of a shared string identity, so a divergent spelling cannot survive a
 * removal even in principle.
 *
 * Kept in its own module so the representation is unit-testable without the
 * index's tokenizer, refresh, and persistence machinery around it.
