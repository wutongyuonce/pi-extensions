 * `extractCachedProjectDiagnostics` — a CACHE-ONLY reader that adapted each
 * analyzer's cached result to `ProjectDiagnostic[]` via a parallel `EXTRACTORS`
 * registry. #585 replaced that reader in production with
 * `fetchFreshProjectDiagnostics` (./fresh-fetch.ts), which triggers-or-joins a
 * fresh run instead of settling for a possibly-hours-stale session_start
 * snapshot. The old reader lingered here wired only to a test — a SECOND,
 * dead surfacing path whose registry could (and did) silently diverge from
 * fresh-fetch's `ANALYZER_IDS`: opengrep was registered here but missing there,
 * so opengrep scanned+cached yet never reached the agent (the exact #585-class
 * regression this cleanup removes). The parallel registry is gone; fresh-fetch
 * is the single source of truth (#883).
 *
 * What survives is the honesty metadata (#533): given an analyzer id that
 * fresh-fetch reported `cold` (not applicable / unavailable this run),
 * `warmTriggerFor` names what WOULD warm it, so the rendered note is actionable
 * rather than a bare "not run".
