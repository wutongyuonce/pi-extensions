/**
 * Agent+user disposition layer over dispatch diagnostics (#690, unifying #181/
 * #503/#504's discussion). Four dispositions:
 *
 *   false-positive — the rule misfired. Project-persistent, routed nowhere
 *                     special yet (telemetry hookup is a fast-follow).
 *   suppress       — real finding, deliberate policy not to fix. Persistent,
 *                     but the mechanism is an inline `pi-lens-ignore` comment
 *                     written into the source (see suppress-writer.ts), not
 *                     just a store entry — portable, git-visible, discoverable
 *                     without pi-lens's own store. The store entry here is an
 *                     audit-trail mirror, not the enforcement point.
 *   defer          — fix later, not now. Session-ephemeral: held in memory
 *                     only, so it naturally resurfaces on process restart —
 *                     never persisted, never needs pruning.
 *   flagged        — user wants the agent to fix this. Persistent until
 *                     resolved; surfaced through the existing lens_diagnostics
 *                     query (tagged), not a separate file/tool the agent has
 *                     to separately poll.
 *
 * Anchoring: TWO flavors, chosen per-disposition because each one binds to a
 * different thing conceptually:
 *
 *   STRICT ("dd:" prefix) — relativeFile|tool|rule|normalizedMessage|
 *     lineContentHash(diagnostic's own line). Used ONLY for false-positive: a
 *     false-positive judgment is about THIS specific piece of code — if the
 *     line is rewritten, the rule earned a fresh chance to fire on the new
 *     content, so the mark should NOT follow it. Reuses read-guard's
 *     lineContentHash so a no-op formatter/whitespace pass doesn't rot the
 *     anchor, while a semantic edit to the flagged line correctly invalidates
 *     it.
 *   WEAK ("ddw:" prefix) — relativeFile|tool|rule|normalizedMessage, no line
 *     hash at all. Used for defer, flagged, and suppress: these are
 *     intent-level judgments ("I'll get to this", "fix this", "policy says
 *     don't") about a finding identity, not about one exact line's bytes —
 *     they must survive incidental edits elsewhere on the flagged line
 *     (reformatting, a nearby rename) without silently dropping the mark.
 *     suppress's real enforcement is the inline comment (see
 *     suppress-writer.ts) which travels with the code by construction; the
 *     weak-anchored store entry is just an audit mirror plus a second,
 *     belt-and-braces filter.
 *
 * Distinct prefixes ("dd:" vs "ddw:") keep the two id spaces from ever
 * colliding in the same store.
 *
 * Content is hashed only from the diagnostic's own line (for the strict
 * anchor), not a surrounding window as #181's original sketch considered.
 * Two diagnostics on the same file/tool/rule/message whose flagged line
 * happens to have identical content collide on the SAME strict anchor —
 * deliberately: identical content at the same rule/message is a semantically
 * equivalent finding, so marking one intentionally marks all of them (e.g. a
 * copy-pasted line repeated a few times in the same file). If that
 * assumption proves wrong in practice, a surrounding-window hash can be
 * layered on later without changing the store shape.

 * diagnostic is never dropped here at all, regardless of any suppress/defer
 * mark. The full `applyDispositions` (content in hand, at the next per-edit
 * dispatch or mode=full merge) is the only place a blocking finding can ever
 * be suppressed, and only via its STRICT branch.

/**
 * Multi-file variant of {@link applyDispositions} for lanes whose findings
 * span many files in ONE report — gitleaks/trivy/govulncheck/opengrep
 * project-wide scans (#1617), unlike the dispatch path's one-`ctx.filePath`-
 * at-a-time shape. Groups by `filePathOf(diagnostic)`, reads each file's
 * CURRENT content once, then delegates to `applyDispositions` per group —
 * same anchor derivation, same strict/weak split, no cloned logic (#1617's
 * single-source-of-truth requirement).
 *
 * Content read is best-effort: a file that no longer exists, or that this
 * process can't read, degrades to `content: ""` for that group rather than
 * dropping its diagnostics outright. `applyDispositions` already treats a
 * missing/empty content argument safely — the STRICT (false-positive) anchor
 * hashes the diagnostic's own line, so an empty content can't collide with a
 * mark made against the file's real content and the finding simply isn't
 * matched (fails OPEN — still reported); the WEAK anchor (suppress/defer)
 * never looks at content at all, so those marks keep applying regardless.
 * This is a deliberate choice, not an oversight: a security finding must
 * never silently vanish just because its file went unreadable at filter
 * time (a security finding staying VISIBLE on a read failure is the safe
 * default; a stale mark quietly reappearing is recoverable, a leaked secret
 * quietly disappearing is not).
 *
 * Review-round F2 (#1625): the empty-store early return is checked HERE,
 * before any per-group file read — not left to `applyDispositions` to notice
 * once already inside the per-group loop. Every mode=full analyzer call
 * (9 lanes) runs through this on every scan, and the overwhelmingly common
 * case is zero marks in the project; measured ~270ms of synchronous
 * `fs.readFileSync` per analyzer per run for that common case before this
 * hoist (reading every finding's file just to discover there was nothing to
 * filter), ~0-1ms after.
