 * `test-runner-client.ts`'s synchronous pytest-on-PATH probe, called from a
 * sync detection path with many sync callers/tests — not a trivial async
 * migration, see #817 follow-up discussion).
 *
 * #817: the Windows branch used to build a `cmd.exe`/`shell:true` command
 * line from unvalidated caller input (CodeQL #17/#18/#19), same unsoundness
 * as the async version had. It now shares the exact same resolution/
 * validation seams as `safeSpawnAsync` — `resolveWindowsCommand` (cached
 * PATH+PATHEXT walk), direct `spawnSync(resolvedPath, args, { shell: false })`
 * for `.exe`/`.com`, the pinned-cmd.exe wrapper + `findCmdUnsafeValue`
 * rejection for `.cmd`/`.bat`, and a synthesized ENOENT when unresolvable.
 * No `shell: true` anywhere.
