 * Shared directory-walk primitives (refs #191, "unify the three divergent
 * source walkers").
 *
 * `source-filter.ts` (`collectSourceFiles`/`collectSourceFilesAsync`),
 * `language-profile.ts` (`collectSourceFilesForWarmup`), and
 * `startup-scan.ts` (`countSourceFilesWithinLimit`/`countSourceFilesWithinLimitAsync`)
 * each re-implement a `readdirSync` + ignore-matcher + exclude-dir walk. The
 * SonarCloud duplication flagged on PR #188's async variants is a symptom of
 * this repeated boilerplate.
 *
 * This module intentionally does NOT own the full traversal loop for any
 * caller. Each walker's loop shape (sync-recursive vs. stack-based, yield
 * cadence, file-classification rules — extensions vs. regex vs. build-artifact
 * detection, hard caps vs. count-and-early-exit) is caller-specific and
 * preserved exactly where it already lived; unifying those would silently
 * change observable behavior (e.g. which files survive a `maxFiles` cap on an
 * over-large tree), which issue #191 explicitly calls out as NOT to do
 * silently.
 *
 * What genuinely was duplicated five times across those files is:
 *   1. The "should I recurse into this directory" decision — ignore-matcher +
 *      exclude-dir-name, plus two checks only `source-filter.ts` needs
 *      (generated-artifact directories, symlink-following).
 *   2. The `readdirSync(..., { withFileTypes: true })` + try/catch-swallow
 *      boilerplate (a missing/unreadable directory is silently skipped).
 * Both are centralized here so there is exactly one place that encodes "what
 * counts as an excluded directory."
