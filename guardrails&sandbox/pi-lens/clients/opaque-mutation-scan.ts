/**
 * Opaque-mutation recovery (#2000 phase 2).
 *
 * A bash command whose writes are NOT recognized by
 * `extractWrittenPathsFromCommand` (python/node/perl/PowerShell internal
 * writes, restores) previously bypassed dispatch AND read-guard authorship.
 * This module observes what such a command actually changed.
 *
 * GIT-FIRST STRATEGY: inside a git worktree the pre side records only a
 * TIMESTAMP; the post side asks `git status --porcelain` which files are
 * dirty and keeps those whose mtime falls inside the command's window.
 * This has NO file-universe bound — it works identically on a 10-file site
 * and a 5000-file monorepo, and content-identical rewrites are correctly
 * NOT reported (a false positive the pure stat-diff design produced).
 *
 * NON-GIT FALLBACK: outside git the pre side takes a bounded stat snapshot
 * (cap enforced, cooperative budget) and the post side diffs it — the
 * original design, kept honestly scoped to small non-git trees.
 *
 * Every failure mode yields an explicit UNKNOWN verdict to the caller —
 * never a clean claim (issue invariant 3). All path keys use
 * normalizeMapKey+resolve, joining the mutation-seam's key form.
 *
 * KNOWN LIMITATIONS:
 * - shape 6: stat-diff identity is size+mtimeMs PLUS a budgeted content-hash
 *   confirm (withHashes captures sha1 up to OPAQUE_HASH_BUDGET_BYTES); a
 *   same-tick/same-size rewrite is detected when both sides hashed the file,
 *   and degrades to mtime+size for files past the hash budget. The git path
 *   detects any content change regardless.
 * - INVARIANT 4 (per issue): ignored/vendor paths are EXCLUDED. Under the
 *   git strategy this means writes landing ONLY in .gitignore'd locations
 *   are never reported - an all-ignored write set reads as an empty (clean)
 *   recovery BY SPEC, not by oversight. Codegen targeting dist/build-style
 *   outputs should use explicit redirect destinations so the extractor
 *   recognizes them.
