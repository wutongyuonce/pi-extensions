/**
 * Shared plumbing for best-effort, fire-and-forget child-process spawns
 * (shape 4 of the recurring-defect catalog in AGENTS.md: "a timer / promise /
 * worker / child that outlives its one-shot settle"). Extracted from the
 * orphan reaper's `unrefReaperChild`/`spawnCollectStdout` (#1153/#1160) into a
 * shared, dependency-free module so every one-shot
 * `spawn(..., { stdio: ["ignore","pipe",...] })` call site in the codebase —
 * the reaper's enumeration/kill spawns AND the resource sampler's Windows
 * CIM/powershell spawns (#1155) — uses the exact same unref+collect shape
 * instead of re-deriving it (also closes the #1155 PR's SonarCloud
 * new-code-duplication finding: two near-identical spawn→collect-stdout
 * blocks in `clients/resource-sampler.ts` collapsed to one shared helper).
 *
 * Deliberately has NO imports beyond `node:child_process` types, so both
 * `clients/instance-reaper.ts` and `clients/resource-sampler.ts` (which
 * `clients/safe-spawn.ts` itself depends on) can import this without risking
 * a circular-import chain.

 * `pi --print`) cannot exit until the child `close`s. Unref only means "do
