/**
 * Turn-boundary freshness gate for cached inline blockers (#1631).
 *
 * An inline blocker recorded for a file F is a verdict about F *and everything F
 * imports*. The existing invalidation paths all key on F alone — a later dispatch
 * of the SAME path returning no blockers, the path ceasing to exist (#1245), and a
 * fresh confirmed-clean verdict (#1561/#1573). When only a DEPENDENCY of F changes,
 * none of those events fire, so F's stale verdict re-served at every turn end for
 * the rest of the session. The live instances in #1631 are exactly that shape: the
 * missing export was added to the dependency (one via a bash script, so the
 * dependency was never dispatched at all — even the same-path event was unreachable
 * by construction).
 *
 * The gate here is a READ-time freshness sweep, not the #1561 dependency-axis
 * invalidation (which stays blocked on a maintainer design decision). Before a cached
 * blocking finding is re-served at turn end, stat the file and its forward imports.
 * The file's own import list comes from the parse layer — no reverse-dependency index
 * is needed, sidestepping the tests-free-index blocker that holds #1561's remainder.
 *
 * Drifted entries are DEMOTED, not dropped (#1419 precedent, as applied by sibling
 * issue #1622): a surviving file whose content drifted gets re-served with a
 * `[stale — re-run to confirm]` marker and out of the authoritative blocker channel,
 * rather than being silently deleted or re-asserted at full authority. The gate never
 * re-pulls LSP verdicts on its own — a drifted entry is marked stale and left for an
 * explicit re-run or the next dispatch to resolve. That keeps the sweep bounded and
 * free of the document-resync hazard the issue calls out (re-querying an LSP whose
 * in-memory dependency document is itself stale would regenerate the stale verdict).
 *
 * Scope (#1631 review F4): an inline blocker is not always LSP-only —
 * `dispatcher.ts` builds it from every `semantic === "blocking"` diagnostic across
 * all runners, so an eslint, biome-check, or ast-grep security-rule (hardcoded
 * secret, CVE) finding can land here too. Only a language-server verdict is
 * actually invalidated by an IMPORT changing; an ast-grep secret match doesn't stop
 * being true because a file it imports was edited. The sweep therefore demotes an
 * entry only when its recorded `sources` (`InlineBlockerRecord.sources`) are ALL
 * `"lsp"` — a mixed or non-LSP-sourced blocker is left fully authoritative, the same
 * fail-closed shape `retireInlineBlockerOnConfirmedClean` already uses for
 * provenance it can't yet reason about.
 *
 * Resolution boundary (#1631 review F8): `extractForwardImportPaths` parses static
 * import/require syntax via tree-sitter. It does not, and cannot, resolve a
 * dependency reached only through a dynamic `import()` or `require()` behind a
 * runtime condition — that edge is invisible to this gate, so a blocker whose only
 * stale dependency arrives that way survives a replay. This is an honest boundary,
 * not a silently-closed one.
 *
 * Delivery cap (#1950). A demoted-but-confirmable entry (`alreadyStale` above)
 * is deliberately NOT retired after its past-EOF sibling's one-delivery rule
 * (#1944, `blocker-past-eof.ts`) — its coordinates are still in bounds, so a
 * fresh dispatch can genuinely confirm or clear it, and retiring on delivery
 * one would discard a recoverable finding. But nothing capped how many times
 * the SAME demoted record re-serves: incident data (#1944's lane sweep) showed
 * 18 `alreadyStale` re-serves in one window, with repeat deliveries carrying
 * near-zero information after the first. `runtime-turn.ts` counts each
 * delivery (`InlineBlockerRecord.staleDeliveryCount`) and retires the record
 * via `RuntimeCoordinator.retireDemotedDependencyDriftBlocker` once it reaches
 * `DEPENDENCY_DRIFT_MAX_DELIVERIES` — a count, not a TTL or a session
 * boundary, because "how many times has the agent already been told" is the
 * quantity that actually went to zero information, not "how much time has
 * passed". The ledger reason says "capped, re-run can still confirm" so it
 * reads distinctly from #1944's "retired, unrecoverable" — a capped record
 * COULD still resolve a fresh dispatch; it just stopped being handed one for
 * free.
