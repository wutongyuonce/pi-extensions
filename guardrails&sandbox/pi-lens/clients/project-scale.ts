/**
 * Single "project scale" knob deriving pi-lens's five independent
 * project-size budgets (#776).
 *
 * Before this module, five subsystems each hardcoded their own file/entry
 * ceiling and degraded independently as a repo grew:
 *
 *   - project-diagnostics scanner: 500 files  (clients/project-diagnostics/scanner.ts)
 *   - review graph:               1,000 files (clients/runtime-config.ts)
 *   - startup scan:               2,000 source files (clients/startup-scan.ts)
 *   - jscpd:                      6,000 dir entries (clients/jscpd-client.ts)
 *   - word index:                 6,000 files (clients/word-index.ts)
 *
 * A large-but-healthy (monorepo-scale) repo would trip these one at a time,
 * silently, with no single lever to say "this repo is big; believe in it".
 *
 * This module centralizes the base value (`maxProjectFiles`, default 2,000 —
 * chosen so every ratio below reproduces today's five defaults exactly) and
 * exposes one `deriveBudget(ratio, cwd)` helper subsystems call instead of
 * declaring their own local constant. Raising `maxProjectFiles` in one place
 * scales all five budgets coherently; this refactor changes no default value.
 *
 * Ratio table (documents today's five defaults at the default base of 2,000):
 *
 *   | Subsystem                    | Ratio | Derived @ base 2,000 | Today  |
 *   |-------------------------------|-------|----------------------|--------|
 *   | project-diagnostics scanner   | 0.25× | 500                  | 500    |
 *   | review graph (#775 R1: tapered above 4,000, see below) | 0.5× | 1,000 | 1,000 |
 *   | startup scan (source files)   | 1×    | 2,000                | 2,000  |
 *   | jscpd (dir entries)           | 3×    | 6,000                | 6,000  |
 *   | word index (files)            | 3×    | 6,000                | 6,000  |
 *
 * The review graph is the ONE budget in this table that stops being a flat
 * ratio above a threshold: {@link getReviewGraphMaxFilesDerived} tapers its
 * growth toward a hard ceiling instead of scaling linearly forever (or
 * cliff-dropping like the pre-#775 flat cap did) — see that function's doc
 * comment for the full rationale. Every OTHER row in this table (and the
 * review graph itself at or below the taper's linear boundary) is still the
 * flat ratio shown.
 *
 * `maxProjectFiles` resolution order (highest priority first) — NOTE this is
 * the base-value chain only; each subsystem's own PRE-EXISTING per-subsystem
 * env override (e.g. `PI_LENS_REVIEW_GRAPH_MAX_FILES`,
 * `PI_LENS_STARTUP_SCAN_MAX_ENTRIES`) is still checked at the call site
 * BEFORE falling back to this module's derived value, so it always wins:
 *
 *   1. `maxProjectFiles` in the project's `.pi-lens.json` (per-project — see
 *      `clients/project-lens-config.ts`). Requires a `cwd`; a call site with
 *      no cwd in hand skips straight to (2).
 *   2. `PI_LENS_MAX_PROJECT_FILES` environment variable.
 *   3. Default: {@link DEFAULT_PROJECT_SCALE_BASE} (2,000).
 *
 * Two entry-UNIT budgets were deliberately left OUT of this derivation:
 * `startup-scan.ts`'s `MAX_STARTUP_SCAN_ENTRIES` (50,000 directory entries)
 * and `source-filter.ts`'s `DEFAULT_MAX_SCAN_ENTRIES` (200,000 directory
 * entries). Both bound directory entries VISITED (a raw tree-walk safety
 * valve, #758/#760), not source files KEPT — a very different quantity whose
 * healthy ratio to file count varies wildly by project shape (a repo with a
 * huge non-source data/asset tree needs a much larger entries budget than its
 * source-file count would suggest). Coupling them to `maxProjectFiles` would
 * risk silently changing behavior on exactly the pathological-tree shapes
 * these ceilings exist to protect, for no behavior-neutral gain; they already
 * have their own env overrides for callers who need to retune them. Left
 * standalone per the issue's "derive or standalone, justify" instruction.

/**
 * Review-graph budget: adaptive taper (#775 R1).
 *
 * At or below {@link REVIEW_GRAPH_LINEAR_CEILING_BASE} this is IDENTICAL to
 * the flat `PROJECT_SCALE_RATIOS.reviewGraph` (0.5x) ratio every other
 * caller of {@link deriveBudget} still uses — every existing small/medium
 * project derivation (including the default-base 1,000-file case) is
 * bit-for-bit unchanged by this function.
 *
 * Above that base, growth SLOWS instead of continuing linearly (a monorepo
 * with a huge `maxProjectFiles` would otherwise get an equally huge,
 * untested review-graph budget) or cutting off at a cliff (today's actual
 * bug: a flat cap truncates the graph to empty above it, per #775's top
 * risk). A hyperbolic taper closes the gap to
 * {@link REVIEW_GRAPH_HARD_CEILING} asymptotically, never reaching or
 * exceeding it: at `base = REVIEW_GRAPH_LINEAR_CEILING_BASE +
 * REVIEW_GRAPH_TAPER_SCALE`, exactly HALF the remaining gap to the ceiling
 * is closed (a standard property of this taper shape) — e.g. base 12,000
 * (6x default) derives ~3,500 files; base 20,000 (10x default) derives
 * ~4,000.
 *
 * {@link REVIEW_GRAPH_HARD_CEILING} (5,000) is grounded FIRST by the
 * strongest real constraint on this number — `review-graph/builder.ts`'s
 * persist circuit-breaker (`GRAPH_PERSIST_MAX_ELEMENTS_DEFAULT`, 500,000
 * graph elements: file/symbol nodes + cross-file edges). Above that element
 * count only a centrality-ranked, honestly-marked partial graph is persisted
 * (#936). Read-only orientation can use it, but the build tier rejects it as
 * a complete incremental base. For symbol-dense repos, element
 * count runs on the order of ~30/file (file node + per-symbol nodes +
 * import/call/reference edges), so a hard ceiling must leave real headroom
 * below 500,000 elements. The file ceiling remains conservative because it
 * also bounds cold-build latency; the persist cap has independent measured
 * headroom through a roughly 420,000-element / 10,000-file graph (#936).
 * 5,000 is also still
 * coherent with the jscpd/wordIndex 3x-ratio precedent (6,000 at the
 * default base) as "the ceiling sits just below that established top
 * tier" rather than an exact match, so it isn't a fresh unrelated
 * constant either.
 *
 * SECOND, independently, the number is consistent with the review graph's
 * own measured per-file BUILD cost: CHANGELOG 3.8.43 ("Persist review graph
 * to disk") documents a full cold tree-sitter + import-fact build taking
 * "2-4 s" at the then-1,000-file cap — roughly 2-4 ms/file. 5,000 files at
 * that rate is a ~10-20 s worst-case cold build — tolerable as a rare
 * one-time cost when the persist cap above is respected (the disk-cached
 * path costs "~20 ms JSON parse + rebuildIndexes" instead, and per-edit
 * builds are incremental — see `diffSignatureMaps`). This build-time
 * argument alone would tolerate a larger ceiling; the persist-cap margin
 * above is the binding constraint.
