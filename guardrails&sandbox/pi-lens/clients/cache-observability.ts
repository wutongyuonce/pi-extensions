/**
 * Prompt-cache observability (#1018).
 *
 * Two provider-independent signals, both sinking into ~/.pi-lens/latency.log
 * via {@link logLatency} (matching the neighboring `type: "phase"` records):
 *
 *   1. Response-side cache usage (`cache_usage`) — on each assistant
 *      `message_end`, record the provider-reported token/cost breakdown so a
 *      session's actual cacheRead/cacheWrite behavior is queryable after the
 *      fact. This is what the provider DID, not what we hoped it would do.
 *
 *   2. Request-side context observations (`cache_context`) — one bounded record
 *      for every `context` call, describing pi-lens's own before/after message
 *      transformation, placement, injection sources, and privacy-preserving
 *      hashes. This is what pi-lens observed locally, not the final provider
 *      request after other context handlers have run and not a provider cache
 *      result. #1938: this record used to also carry a `prefixObservation` /
 *      `firstMessageChange` pair derived from a SEPARATE bounded hash of the
 *      pre-injection prefix (capped at `MAX_HASHED_MESSAGES` messages /
 *      `MAX_HASHED_CONTENT_CHARS` chars). Every real session's transcript
 *      exceeds that cap almost immediately, so the pair reported "unknown" on
 *      97% of records — dead weight in every record, answering nothing. The
 *      pair is removed; signal 3 below (`cache_prefix_break`) already covers
 *      first-message stability with an unbounded hash and never truncates.
 *
 *   3. Request-side prefix stability (`cache_prefix_break`) — a content hash of
 *      `messages[0]` observed on every `context` call. After #1016 the first
 *      message must stay byte-stable across a whole session; a logged CHANGE
 *      flags that something (pi-lens or otherwise) broke the cache prefix. This
 *      remains a local observation, never a provider cache-miss claim.
 *
 * #1071 adds miss ATTRIBUTION on top of those three. Each `cache_usage` record
 * carries the inter-turn gap and a `cacheMissCause` verdict, and each
 * `cache_context` record splits a mixed injection payload by contributing
 * source. #1996 makes every unexplained miss name the absent/conflicting
 * evidence and emits one fixed-key `cache_usage_summary` at session shutdown.
 * Heuristic causes require complete request hashing and full provider/model
 * identity evidence. Identity comparison uses SHA-256 over the full normalized
 * value while logs retain only a bounded display prefix; malformed numeric
 * usage is sanitized before it reaches JSON metadata.
 * The per-turn records still ride events that already fire once per turn, and
 * all attribution derives from bounded in-process state — nothing reads
 * latency.log back or serializes transcript content.
 *
 * All paths are defensive: `usage` (and its fields) may be absent on older
 * hosts or non-assistant messages, so every access is guarded and the handlers
 * never throw — on error they `dbg(...)` and no-op, like the other index.ts
 * event handlers.

 *

 *      byte-stable throughout, so this verdict should stay rare; if it does
 *      not, #1016's fix has regressed.
 *   2. `model-provider-changed` — both adjacent identities were present and
 *      differ. This is direct local evidence and outranks timing heuristics.
 *   3. Evidence gates — heuristic causes require a REQUEST-time observation,
 *      a complete bounded sequence hash, adjacent full provider/model identity,
 *      and well-formed provider usage numbers.
 *      Missing evidence returns a specific unknown reason; it never lets a
 *      plausible but unproved heuristic win.
 *   4. `ttl-expired` — a REQUEST-time gap reached the configured provider TTL.
 *      A message-end fallback includes generation time and cannot prove this.
 *   5. `partial-eviction` — a non-zero but low read, where fresh input runs far
 *      above the new content we measured. pi-lens injections average ~2.7
 *      estimated tokens per turn, so they cannot account for a multiple of the
 *      measured content; the remainder is provider-side eviction, typically at
 *      a context limit. Suppressed when the character accumulators were capped,
 *      because a floor estimate would manufacture the verdict.
 *   6. `unknown` — a real shortfall with no local explanation. A bounded
 *      `cacheMissUnknownReason` names the missing or conflicting evidence;
