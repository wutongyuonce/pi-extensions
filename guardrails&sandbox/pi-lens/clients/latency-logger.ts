 * #1432 review: `advisory_provenance_decision`,

 *
 * `lsp_aux_wait_outcome` (#1458) is DIFFERENT from every entry above: its
 * `durationMs` is a REAL bounded wait, not zero-duration decision telemetry.
 * WHICH wait depends on the row's `waitShape` (#1533), so read that field before
 * comparing two rows: `"aux_grace"` measures only the post-primary auxiliary
 * grace (up to a few seconds), while `"aggregate"` — the `clientScope: "all"`
 * producer, which arms no grace of its own — measures the whole diagnostics wait
 * from before the primaries settled. The `"aggregate"` number is therefore
 * systematically larger for the same auxiliary; it is not a regression. It is
 * still
 * excluded because it is a WAIT-OUTCOME RECORD written after the aux wait
 * already completed, not the stall itself — that wait ran inside the
 * `lsp_touch_file`/diagnostics phase surrounding it, so letting this summary
 * row win `lastPhase` would misattribute a `loop_block` to the record instead
 * of to whatever phase is actually stalled when the block fires.
 * #1453: `tool_set_mutation` records an active-tool-set rewrite (zero-duration
 * bookkeeping, and it fires during session_start where a real stall must stay
 * attributed to the work around it), so it is excluded for the same reason.
 * #1467: `availability_decision` records a tool-probe verdict. Its `durationMs`
 * is the child's own probe time (often zero for a fast path or a cached
 * decision) and the record is bookkeeping ABOUT a probe, not host work — a
 * loop_block landing next to one must stay attributed to whatever really
 * stalled the loop, which is frequently the very thing that expired the probe.
 *
 * #1461 slice 1: `finding_dead_path_drop` is the same shape — the record a
 * delivery seam writes when it drops findings whose cited path no longer
 * exists. #1622 adds `finding_stale_line_demote`, its sibling for findings
 * whose cited file was edited after the scan.
 *
 * #1459: the three scanner-coverage records are summary rows written from inside
 * `lsp_touch_file`, and two of them carry ANOTHER write's age as `durationMs`
 * (`lsp_notify_resync_deferred`, `lsp_notify_write_late_landed`) rather than
 * their own work. `lsp_scanner_coverage_gap` reports the touch's elapsed time for
 * joinability. Letting any of them win `lastPhase` would attribute a `loop_block`
 * to the record instead of to the touch that is actually stalled.
 *
 * #1996: `cache_usage_summary` is a zero-duration session rollup over earlier
 * usage records. It reports no new work and therefore cannot own last-phase
 * stall attribution.
 *
 * #2249: `concurrent_session_bind_rollup` is the same shape as
 * `session_end_bus_rollup`/`path_attribution_verified_rollup` above — a
 * zero-duration session-end summary of records already logged individually,
 * not new work of its own.
 *
 * #2044: `test_runner_failed_target_state` is a zero-duration decision after a

 *
 * Ranked by CONTAINMENT FRACTION (`overlapMs / max(elapsedMs, windowLengthMs)`),
 * not raw overlap (#1723 review round 4, N1 — after round 3's elapsedMs
 * tie-break turned out not to engage in practice). Raw overlap is capped at
 * the window's own length, and a LIVE bracket's end is always `nowMs` — the
 * window's own end — so a long-lived, still-running INNOCENT bracket always
 * scores the maximum possible raw overlap. A genuine CLOSED culprit can only
 * match that by closing at the exact sample instant, which `turn_end` never
 * does: it samples milliseconds AFTER the culprit's `finally` runs, so the
 * culprit's raw overlap is always slightly short of the window's full length
 * — round 3's "exact tie" tie-break never engaged, and the innocent bracket
 * won every time on raw overlap alone. Fraction fixes this structurally: a
 * culprit whose own lifetime roughly IS the window scores close to 1.0
 * regardless of a few milliseconds of sampling lag, while a long-lived
 * innocent bracket that merely CONTAINS the window scores meaningfully
 * lower (its `elapsedMs` denominator is bigger).
 *
 * The denominator is `max(elapsedMs, windowLengthMs)`, not bare `elapsedMs`
 * (#1723 review round 5, R1 — the fraction metric's own blind spot). A bare
 * `elapsedMs` denominator meant a SHORT bracket wholly INSIDE the window
 * scored a perfect, undeserved 1.0 (`overlapMs === elapsedMs` whenever a
 * bracket never spills past either window edge) and beat a real culprit
 * whose bracket spans slightly MORE than the window — e.g. a 1s innocent
 * bracket fully inside an 18.27s window outscored a genuine 19.27s-lifetime
 * culprit that explains the whole window and then some. Using the WINDOW's
 * length as a floor on the denominator caps the achievable fraction at
 * `overlapMs / windowLengthMs` for any bracket no bigger than the window
 * itself, so a small bracket can no longer out-rank a big one purely by
 * being small; a bracket LARGER than the window still divides by its own
 * `elapsedMs`, so the round-4 sampling-lag fix (a big bracket's fraction
 * tracks how much of ITS OWN lifetime overlaps) is unaffected. Free
 * improvement noted while verifying this: it also further demotes an N3
 * leaked bracket when something is competing against it (its `elapsedMs`
 * denominator, already large, only grows).
 *
 * The round-3 elapsedMs comparison is kept as the tie-break for a genuine
 * FRACTION tie (two candidates scoring identically) — still reachable under
 * this metric: two brackets that both partially overlap the window by the
 * SAME amount (`overlapMs` equal) but have different lifetimes both share the
 * `windowLengthMs` denominator (since both are ≤ the window), so their
 * fractions tie while their `elapsedMs` differs. See
 * `tests/clients/latency-logger.test.ts` for a constructed example.
 *
 * The tie-break compares within an EPSILON band (`FRACTION_TIE_EPSILON` =
 * `1e-4`), not exact `===` equality (#1723 review round 6, R3). Co-starting
 * — two brackets opening with the identical `startedAt` millisecond string
 * — is the NORMAL path, not an edge case: `dispatchForFile` launches its
 * runner groups via `Promise.all`, and a runner's `when` precondition awaits
 * only microtasks, so this happens routinely. Closed form for a culprit
 * that closes `lag` ms before the sample versus a co-started bracket that
 * stays live: the culprit scores `1 - lag/W`, the co-started bracket scores
 * `1/(1 + lag/W)` — the co-started bracket wins by `(lag/W)^2`, which at a
 * real `W` = 18 270ms and `lag` = 5ms is ~7e-8 — far below millisecond
 * timestamp resolution, so an EXACT tie never actually engages and the
 * "winner" becomes floating-point rounding noise instead. `1e-4` is well
 * above any realistic `(lag/W)^2` term (a co-started pair collapses into it)
 * and well below the gap between two genuinely different candidates in every
 * test/probe this module has been checked against.
 *
 * The tie-break is a TWO-PASS selection over every candidate, not a
 * single-pass streaming comparison (#1723 review round 7, S1 — a blocker).
 * A single running `bestFraction`, reassigned on every accepted candidate
 * INCLUDING a tie-win, chains: "near" is not transitive, so three candidates
 * at fractions 0.600000 / 0.600080 / 0.600160 (adjacent gaps inside the
 * epsilon band, but the OUTER gap between the first and third outside it)
 * let the running best walk across the whole band one hop at a time — the
 * final answer then depends on SCAN ORDER, reachable at roughly 1.5ms of
 * overlap difference in an 18s window, which is routine under `Promise.all`
 * co-start with three or more candidates. Reseeding `bestFraction` via
 * `Math.max(...)` alone does not fix this — the defect is the chaining
 * itself, not the seed value. The fix: pass 1 finds the maximum fraction
 * across ALL candidates (a plain reduction, immune to order); pass 2 keeps
 * only the candidates within the epsilon band OF THAT MAXIMUM — not of each
 * other, and not of a running value that could itself have drifted — and
 * picks the smallest `elapsedMs` among them. Order-independent by
 * construction: the three-candidate example above always excludes the
 * first candidate (its gap from the true maximum exceeds the epsilon, even
 * though its gap from its immediate neighbor does not), regardless of scan
 * order.
 *
 * Composes with N4's plausibility floor below in the natural order: the
 * floor FILTERS candidates (an implausibly short bracket is never even a
 * candidate for fraction ranking, and never enters the `candidates` array at
 * all); fraction then RANKS the survivors via the two passes above. A
 * bracket that clears the floor always has a well-defined fraction in (0, 1].
 *
 * A candidate needs a STRICTLY POSITIVE overlap: `if (fraction <= 0) return;`
 * enforces that explicitly, before the candidate is even collected — pass 1's
 * `maxFraction` is seeded at 0 and only ever updated by a STRICTLY GREATER
 * value, so without this guard a lone zero-or-negative-fraction candidate
 * would sit "within the epsilon band of the seeded 0" in pass 2 and be
 * wrongly attributed. #1723 review N2 deleted an EARLIER version of this
 * guard as dead code under the round-2 single-pass design, where a strict
 * `>` comparison against a 0-seeded running best already excluded it with no
 * help needed — that reasoning does not carry over to the two-pass shape,
 * where pass 2's job is specifically to find candidates NEAR a seed value.
 *
 * This is the seam that makes the SYNCHRONOUS motivating case attributable at
 * all: the offending phase's `finally` (a microtask) always runs before
 * `turn_end` (a macrotask) samples, so by the time this is called the
 * bracket has typically already moved from `liveBrackets` to
 * `closedBrackets` — checking only the live set reads empty for exactly that
 * case, which is why `getCurrentPhase` alone was not enough.
 *
 * KNOWN RESIDUAL (#1723 review round 4, stated not fixed): a leaked bracket
 * (see `phaseFinished`'s doc comment on N3) with NO competing candidate still
 * wins any window it fully contains, however many times over its own
 * lifetime exceeds the window — fraction ranking only demotes a leak when
 * something else is competing for the same window. A ceiling on elapsedMs
 * relative to the window length (e.g. reject a candidate whose lifetime is
 * some large multiple of the window) would close this, at the cost of a
 * second magic number; left open pending a concrete false-positive to size
 * it against.
 *
 * Caveat for an automated consumer (e.g. #1549's loop_block ↔
 * lsp_diagnostics_timeout correlation): the window's own end is `now` at
 * SAMPLE time, which assumes the block ended right when `turn_end` read
 * `getEventLoopStats()` — a reasonable approximation, not a measured fact.
 * `startedAt`/`elapsedMs`/`stillRunning` on the returned attribution let a
 * human reader judge that assumption per-record; an automated correlation
 * should account for the same slack rather than treating the window edges as
 * exact.

	// bug is the CHAINING, not the seed value.
	//
	// Fixed with two independent passes instead, order-independent by
	// construction:
	//   Pass 1 finds the MAXIMUM fraction across every candidate — a plain
	//     reduction, immune to scan order.
	//   Pass 2 keeps only the candidates within `FRACTION_TIE_EPSILON` OF
	//     THAT MAXIMUM (not of each other, and not of a running "best" that
	//     could itself have already drifted) and picks the smallest
	//     `elapsedMs` among THEM. In the three-candidate example above, only
	//     the two candidates within the band of the true maximum (0.600160)
	//     compete; the third, whose gap from the maximum exceeds the epsilon
	//     even though its gap from its IMMEDIATE neighbor does not, is
	//     correctly excluded regardless of which order the three were
	//     scanned in.

 *
 * #1723 review F4 — placement is deliberate, and DIFFERENT from
 * `warmDispatchAtSessionStart()`: call this only once `session_start` has
 * confirmed it is running a FULL session start (`decideSessionStart(...)
 * .runFullSessionStart`), i.e. from BEHIND the #473 concurrent-secondary
 * gate, not before it. The reason is the opposite of what an unconditional,
 * "re-arm on every session_start" placement would give: this module's state
 * is process-shared across every concurrently-live activation in the same
 * process, exactly like the LSP fleet / runtime generation #473 already
 * protects — a concurrent secondary's `session_start` firing while the
 * PARENT activation has genuinely in-flight brackets must not wipe the
 * parent's live attribution out from under it. Only a real sequential
 * session replacement (new/resume/fork/reload confirmed by
 * `decideSessionStart`) may safely assume no other activation still owns
 * live brackets in this process. A concurrent secondary's OWN torn-down
 * brackets are still covered: each caller's `phaseFinished` runs in its own
 * try/finally, and if that activation is torn down hard enough to skip even
 * that, the accepted cost is a stale bracket that the NEXT full session start
 * clears — not a wrong clear of a sibling that is still working.
