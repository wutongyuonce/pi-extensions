/**
 * Persistent NDJSON trace of `pi.events` bus publish attempts
 * (`pilens:files:touched` #482 / `pilens:diagnostics` #502 /
 * `pilens:diagnostic:disposition` / `pilens:format:queued` +
 * `pilens:format:start` + `pilens:autofix:start` #673/#684 /
 * `pi-lens/analysis-complete` + `pi-lens/findings` + `pi-lens/turn-findings`
 * #1415) — nine event names across five producers.
 *
 * All five producers (clients/bus-publish.ts, clients/diagnostics-publish.ts,
 * clients/disposition-publish.ts, clients/format-events-publish.ts,
 * clients/lens-events.ts) are fire-and-forget: on failure or on a structural
 * no-op (never wired, kill switch off) the four #482/#502/#673/#684
 * producers only invoke an optional `dbg` callback, which varies by host and
 * is a documented no-op in the MCP host (clients/mcp/session.ts's
 * `dbg: noop`); `lens-events.ts` (#1415) has no `dbg` param at all — its
 * events are purely observational inter-extension telemetry, so this NDJSON
 * trace is its ONLY failure-visible surface. Either way, that leaves
 * bus-publish outcomes invisible in exactly the context where they matter
 * most — same failure shape as the #544 MCP session_start incident this repo
 * already fixed once.
 *
 * This module gives bus events the same durable trace every other pi-lens
 * subsystem already has (latency.log, cascade.log, read-guard.log, ...) —
 * see clients/latency-logger.ts for the house pattern this mirrors exactly:
 * one shared `createNdjsonLogger` writer, `isTestMode()` no-op guard,
 * `getBusEventsLogPath()` for testability.
 *
 * Logging volume: `emitted` and `emit_failed` are logged on every call —
 * they're the two outcomes an operator actually needs a per-event trace for.
 * `skipped_unwired` and `skipped_disabled` are process-lifetime-static facts
 * (wiring happens once at extension factory time; the kill switch is an env
 * var read once at startup) — logging them on every publish attempt would
 * spam one identical line per write batch for an entire session with zero
 * new information after the first. Both are gated log-once-per-process, the
 * same `hasLoggedFailure` shape the producers already use for emit_failed.
 * `skipped_stale_session` is an info-level per-occurrence outcome: the emit
 * seam intentionally declined a target whose associated ctx was confirmed
 * stale, so it is neither a bus failure nor input for the smells rollup.
 * The empty-batch branch (`paths.length === 0` / `files.length === 0`) is
 * NOT logged at all: every call site already guards against invoking these
 * functions with nothing to report (see clients/pipeline.ts,
 * clients/runtime-agent-end.ts), so it's a normal, frequent no-op rather
 * than a real event worth a log line.
