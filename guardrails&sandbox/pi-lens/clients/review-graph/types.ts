	 * candidates existed graph-wide (or a same-file import/receiver-type hint
	 * failed to narrow it), so `edge.to` may point at an unresolved placeholder
	 * node or, ambiguously, could be the wrong same-named symbol.
	 *
	 * Four increasingly-specific non-"name-only" tiers (refs #655 phase 2,
	 * narrow slice of its full `resolution` enum — no `invocation` tracking):
	 * - `"exact"`: exactly one same-named real symbol existed anywhere in the
	 *   graph at resolution time — provably unambiguous by uniqueness alone.
	 * - `"import"`: the calling file's own import statements name exactly which
	 *   file the bare-name callee comes from (e.g. `import { run } from
	 *   "./service.js"`), narrowing the candidate set to that file BEFORE the
	 *   graph-wide uniqueness check; resolved when that file has exactly one
	 *   same-named symbol. Currently computed for jsts only (see builder.ts's
	 *   `addJsTsFile` — the only ingestion path with import-specifier names
	 *   already extracted per call site).
	 * - `"receiver-type"`: a member-expression call (`obj.method()`) whose
	 *   receiver's class is determinable from the SAME file's tree-sitter parse
	 *   (a `new ClassName()` assignment or a typed parameter/variable
	 *   declaration immediately visible in the same function) resolves directly
	 *   to that class's same-named method — bypassing bare-name ambiguity
	 *   entirely. jsts-only for this slice (see builder.ts's
	 *   `resolveReceiverType`); cross-module receivers, generics, and dynamic
	 *   dispatch are conservatively left `"name-only"` rather than guessed.
	 *
	 * None of these three type-check or scope-resolve like a real compiler —
	 * they narrow candidates structurally and only ever upgrade past
	 * `"name-only"` when the match is unambiguous by construction; an
	 * under-determined case always stays `"name-only"`, never a wrong
	 * upgrade. Undefined for edge kinds where resolution confidence doesn't
	 * apply (`imports`/`contains`/`defines`) and for `calls` edges to a
	 * definite external target (`callee.includes(".")` with no in-project
	 * receiver hint, in builder.ts).
