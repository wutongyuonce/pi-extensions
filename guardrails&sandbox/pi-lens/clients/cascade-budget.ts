/**
 * Cascade neighbour-budget sizing (#1462).
 *
 * The flat neighbour cap (40) and the turn-end settle wait (5000 ms) were set in
 * two different files with nothing relating them. Dogfood 2026-08-15 measured
 * what that costs: n=50 cascades, median 30 ms, max 3.88 s at nbr=40 — and with
 * a `reverse_deps_cache` refresh ahead of the graph build (2046 ms for
 * `logger.ts`) the run overran the turn_end cap, so `cascade_settle_wait`
 * returned `settled: 0` and the finding arrived a turn late.
 *
 * ## What a slow run actually costs
 *
 * It is NOT lost. `RuntimeCoordinator.settleCascadeRuns` re-parks a promise
 * still in flight at the cap, `agent_settled` gives it a second and more
 * generous drain (`cascade_carry_over_settle`, `quietWindowWaitMs`, 15 000 ms),
 * and `beginTurn` deliberately keeps `_pendingCascadeRuns` so anything still
 * running surfaces at a later turn_end — that is #1443, and pre-#450 these
 * findings were always awaited. So the real trade is:
 *
 *   full neighbour set, one turn late   vs.   a narrowed set, on time,
 *                                             with the remainder lost for good
 *
 * Narrowing is therefore only worth paying for when it genuinely converts a
 * late run into an on-time one. That gives three zones, and the derivation
 * below is exactly those three:
 *
 *   fits         the full walk still fits the on-time window — nothing to do
 *   narrowed     the RESCUE BAND: the full walk no longer fits but a shorter
 *                one does, so trading the tail for on-time delivery buys
 *                something real
 *   past-rescue  not even a floor-sized walk fits any more, so narrowing would
 *                drop neighbours permanently AND still miss the window. Keep
 *                the full budget and let the carry-over deliver it complete.
 *                This is the cold-session case: a fresh graph build measures up
 *                to ~19 s (see `runtime-coordinator.ts`'s carry-over note), and
 *                a floor-sized stub there is strictly worse than pre-#1462.
 *
 * One more guard, for the same reason. If the on-time window could not fit a
 * full walk even at zero prelude, there is no LATE run to rescue — every
 * cascade would be permanently downsized because a *wait* was configured small.
 * That is a budget change wearing a timeout's clothes, so the derivation stands
 * down entirely (`no-rescue-window`) and the flat cap applies. This is what
 * keeps `PI_LENS_CASCADE_SETTLE_WAIT_MS` from doubling as a neighbour-count
 * knob: at the 5000/100/40 defaults the band is a prelude of 1.0–4.5 s, and
 * shrinking the wait to 1000 ms disables narrowing rather than capping every
 * cascade at ~10 neighbours.
