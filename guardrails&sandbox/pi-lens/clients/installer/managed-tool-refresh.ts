/**
 * Periodic version refresh for pi-lens's managed tools (#1730, #1747).
 *
 * #1730 covered the npm strategy. #1747 extends the SAME cadence, stamp file,
 * session budget and degradation kind to the other five rather than building a
 * second mechanism: github (27 entries), pip (6), archive (4), maven (1) and
 * gem (1) were all frozen at whatever the installer resolved on day one,
 * because `installTool` only runs when the tool is ABSENT. The only per-
 * strategy difference is the re-resolution step, which lives in
 * `installer/index.ts`'s `refreshManagedTool`.
 *
 * `~/.pi-lens/tools/package.json` records ranges, not versions — `npm install
 * knip` writes `"knip": "^6.4.1"` and a lockfile pinning 6.4.1. Nothing ever
 * re-resolved that range, so the managed copy stayed on the version present at
 * first install for the life of the machine. A managed knip 28 minors behind
 * produced 62 unused-export findings on a tree the same project's own knip
 * reported clean, and acting on those findings deletes live code. Every managed
 * npm tool drifts the same way; a stale pyright or biome is the same wrong
 * verdict, quieter.
 *
 * The policy, and the constraints each part answers:
 *
 * - Bounded. At most `maxPerSession` tools (default 1) are refreshed per
 *   session, and each tool is eligible again only once per `intervalMs`
 *   (default 7 days). A managed tools tree with 22 entries therefore costs at
 *   most one `npm update` spawn per session, never one per run and never a
 *   22-package burst.
 * - Off the hot path. `runManagedToolRefresh` is never awaited by a caller
 *   that serves a user request; `runtime-session.ts` schedules it on an
 *   unref'd background timer after `session_start` has already returned.
 * - Non-blocking for availability. A refresh failure never removes or hides
 *   the installed copy. `npm update` leaves the existing tree in place, and
 *   this module never touches `node_modules` itself, so the current version
 *   keeps serving.
 * - Re-armed per session, not per process. The per-session budget is keyed to
 *   the degradation ledger's session generation, so a long-lived process that
 *   serves many `/new` sessions re-checks eligibility each time — and the
 *   REAL cooldown lives in the persisted stamp, not in process memory, so a
 *   restart loop cannot turn a 7-day cadence into an every-launch one.
 * - Empty is not the same as errored. A missing stamp file means "never
 *   refreshed" and makes every tool eligible. An UNREADABLE stamp file means
 *   the cadence is unknown; the session degrades once and refreshes nothing,
 *   rather than treating unknown as fresh (drift forever) or as stale (a
 *   22-package burst on every session).
