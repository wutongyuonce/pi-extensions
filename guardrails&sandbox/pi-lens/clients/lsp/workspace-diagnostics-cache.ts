//   was unbounded; the bound is new and costs at most one extra sweep for a
//   cwd that fell off the end.
// - `normalizeMapKey` runs `realpathSync.native` on Windows. A handle re-runs
//   it only after the map has been invalidated, so an uninterrupted sweep pays

 * #1782: decide whether an entry has aged out of its right to be SERVED.
 *
 * The bound applies only to entries that assert findings. That asymmetry is
 * deliberate, not an oversight:
 *
 * - A finding-bearing entry makes a POSITIVE claim ("this file has errors
 *   right now"). Replayed after the config that produced it changed, it renders
 *   as a current blocking gate failure that no gate ever ran — the #1782
 *   defect, where five `typescript:2339` errors born under inferred settings
 *   (#1640) were still rendered as fresh `blocking` rows 28 hours and one
 *   session later, because no newer pull ever re-answered those files and
 *   nothing expired them.
 * - A clean entry makes only a NEGATIVE claim: "the file and its dependencies
 *   are unchanged". Expiring clean entries too would force a full re-touch of
 *   every swept file on the first sweep of every session, which is the exact
 *   cost #671 built this cache to avoid, while the harm it would prevent is a
 *   missing finding rather than a fabricated blocker.
 *
 * So the re-touch volume this policy adds is bounded by the number of files
 * that previously REPORTED something, not by the size of the repo.
 *
 * #1786 review F4, closed by #1793: `isEntryFresh` used to fail OPEN to
 * mtime-only whenever `getImports` returned `undefined` — no
 * reverse-dependency index this session, which is the normal state of a cold
 * session before the cascade has built one — for EVERY clean entry,
 * regardless of what it had asserted when it was recorded. #1793 closes that
 * for any entry recorded WHILE a dependency index was available
 * (`depIndexAtScan`): such an entry now refuses to serve on a later,
 * index-less session instead of falling back to mtime-only, and the refused
 * entry is evicted rather than left to be refused again forever (see the
 * `lookup` doc comment on the deletion below).
 *
 * ACCEPTED, not residual: an entry recorded on an EQUALLY cold session
 * (`depIndexAtScan` false/absent, including every entry on disk from before
 * this fix) keeps the mtime-only fallback. It never asserted more than
 * mtime-only could verify in the first place, so there is nothing stronger
 * to hold it to — this is exactly the population #1793's acceptance
 * criteria left alone, not a gap this policy silently reopens. #1814 closed
 * a narrower, adjacent gap in the per-file dependency check itself: a
 * session WITH a warm index could still fail-open per-file for a file
 * outside that index's own coverage (see `getImports`'s doc comment below).

 *    match against `entry.mtimeMs`) — any drift, or a stat failure
 *    (deleted/unreadable), invalidates. #2300: when the entry also carries a
 *    `sizeBytes`, the current size must match too — an external rewrite that
 *    lands in the same mtime bucket with a different length is otherwise
 *    invisible to mtime alone. A pre-#2300 entry without `sizeBytes` fails
 *    OPEN to the mtime-only check (see the field's doc comment).
 * 2. When a reverse-dependency index is available (`getImports` returns an
 *    array rather than `undefined`), every file THIS file imports must not
 *    have changed after `entry.scannedAt` either — this is the fix for the
 *    cross-file blind spot plain mtime-checking has: a TypeScript diagnostic
 *    on file A can change purely because a dependency B's exported shape
 *    changed, with zero edits to A's own bytes/mtime.
 *
 * `getImports` returning `undefined` means "this file's dependency claim
 * can't be verified this session" — either no dependency graph is available
 * at all (no cascade/session-start has built `clients/reverse-deps.ts`'s
 * persisted index yet), OR an index IS available but was never told about
 * THIS file (#1814: the index exists and covers other files, just not this
 * one — `getImports` used to mask that second case with `?? []`, coercing it
 * to an empty array and letting the loop below iterate zero times and report
 * fresh, indistinguishable from a file the index actually confirmed has zero
 * imports). Both are real, expected states — we fail OPEN per-file to
 * mtime-only invalidation in that case, UNLESS the entry itself was recorded
 * while a dependency index WAS available for THIS file (`entry.depIndexAtScan`
 * — see its doc comment for the per-file vs whole-session distinction, #1793
 * review F2). #1793/#1814: such an entry asserted a stronger claim than
 * mtime-only can back up, so serving it through the weaker check just
 * because THIS session can't verify it (whole-session cold, or this file
 * just outside coverage) would resurrect the exact blind spot #1786's
 * review flagged (F4) — a project-wide dependency change invisible for as
 * long as the file's own bytes stay untouched. `lookup` (the sole caller)
 * DELETES an entry this function refuses for that reason, rather than
 * leaving it to be refused again on every later cold sweep (#1793 review
 * F3) — see its own doc comment for why eviction, not a stamp downgrade,
 * bounds the repeat cost. An entry recorded on an equally cold session
 * (`depIndexAtScan` false/absent) never made that stronger claim, so it
 * keeps the mtime-only fallback — matching the same blind spot the
 * cheap-tier `project-diagnostics.json` cache already accepts today; that is
 * accepted design for #1793's acceptance criteria, not a gap this function
 * reopens. Once a reverse-deps index covers this file, this function
 * upgrades to using it automatically — no separate cache format/version
 * needed.
 *
 * #1708 sweep: the dependency check below compares a captured `scannedAt`
 * against each dependency's mtime, the same shape `findingPathFreshness`
 * under-tolerated. `MTIME_DRIFT_TOLERANCE_MS` (`blocker-freshness.ts`) keeps
