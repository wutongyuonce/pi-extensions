 * early when results meet a quality threshold, optionally with a grace window
 * to let more results accumulate.
 *
 * @param promises - Array of promises producing results
 * @param shouldComplete - Called after each settled promise with all results
 *   accumulated so far. Return true to trigger early completion.
 * @param options.timeoutMs - Hard deadline; after this, resolve with whatever is ready
 * @param options.graceMs - After shouldComplete returns true, wait this many ms
 *   for additional results before finalizing. 0 = finalize immediately.
 * @param options.descriptors - Optional per-promise role descriptors (parallel array
 *   to `promises`). When any descriptor carries `role:"auxiliary"`, an
 *   additional policy applies: once all PRIMARY-role promises settle, auxiliaries
 *   receive `options.auxGraceMs` before the race finalises. Aux results within
 *   that window are included; later arrivals are dropped. When no descriptors
 *   carry `role:"auxiliary"` the aux-grace path is never entered.
 * @param options.auxGraceMs - Ceiling on the grace period given to auxiliary
 *   promises after all primary promises have settled. Only relevant when at
 *   least one descriptor carries `role:"auxiliary"`. Defaults to 500ms. When a
 *   still-pending auxiliary's descriptor carries `budgetMs`, the actual window
 *   is `min(auxGraceMs, max(budgetMs of still-pending auxiliaries))` — see
 *   `PromiseDescriptor.budgetMs`.
