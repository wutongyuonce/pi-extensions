 *     EXPLICIT ENUMERABLE fields on that wrapper, so a `[...]`/`.map`/`.filter`/
 *     `structuredClone`/`JSON` copy of the DIAGNOSTICS (`.diags`) can no longer
 *     drop them: the copy operates on `.diags`, the flags stay on the wrapper.
 *   - `getAllDiagnostics` still attaches `binding` as a lazy, disk-verifying
 *     NON-enumerable getter on each Map entry — deliberately NOT migrated to an
 *     enumerable field, because enumerable would make an incidental spread/serialize
 *     eagerly trigger the per-entry disk stat+hash (a stat storm the cascade's
 *     TTL-gated read exists to avoid). That getter therefore KEEPS the read-off-
 *     original contract:
 *       - READ IT OFF THE ORIGINAL producer entry, never off a derived copy. Any
 *         `{...entry}` / `structuredClone` / `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(...))`
 *         between the producer and the read SILENTLY DROPS the getter — the consumer
 *         then reads `undefined` (indistinguishable from "unknown") and skips the
 *         #1092 staleness demotion. This is the class that bit as #1094
 *         (`inconclusive`) and #1096 (`binding`); the cascade reads the binding off
 *         the original `entry` BEFORE any copy for exactly this reason
 *         (`clients/dispatch/integration.ts` `readBoundToCurrentDisk`).
 *   - IF A FLAG MUST CROSS A SERIALIZATION BOUNDARY (the warm-attach IPC socket, a
 *     JSON round-trip), re-surface it as an EXPLICIT enumerable field on the
 *     transport DTO — no side-channel (enumerable or not) survives `JSON.stringify`
 *     of a `.diags` array. See `clients/warm-attach.ts`/`clients/mcp/ipc.ts`, which
