/**
 * #1640: honest rendering for TypeScript diagnostics on files that belong to no
 * tsconfig project.
 *
 * When a file matches no project's `include`/`files`, tsserver still checks it —
 * in a synthetic INFERRED project with default compiler options, no `types`
 * from the project's `tsconfig`, and different module resolution. The project's
 * own `tsc --noEmit` never looks at those files, so the two answers legitimately
 * disagree. Presenting the inferred answer at full blocking authority tells the
 * agent that a gate failed when no gate ever ran.
 *
 * The fix is DEMOTE-WITH-LABEL, never suppress. The live #1640 triage found the
 * inferred-project batch was a MIX: some diagnostics were provably phantom
 * (missing test-runner globals, module resolution), and others were genuine type
 * errors the project's `tsc` gate cannot see precisely BECAUSE the files sit
 * outside every project. Suppression would hide the real ones. Blocking would
 * overstate confidence in the phantom ones. Demoting to warning and naming the
 * config gap preserves the signal and hands the verification burden to the
 * person who can close it.
 *
 * Every "we do not know" path leaves the diagnostics untouched. An unanswered
 * `projectInfo` probe is not a verdict (AGENTS.md shape 10).
