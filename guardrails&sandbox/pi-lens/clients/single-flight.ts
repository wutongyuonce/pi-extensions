/**
 * `singleFlight` — at most one execution per key, clear owned by the primitive.
 *
 * Ten sites hand-roll the same five lines: look up a key in a promise map,
 * return the existing promise if there is one, otherwise start the work and
 * delete the key in a `finally`. The class has a measured bug yield, and every
 * bug is in the part the call site wrote rather than the part it meant:
 *
 * - #1690: the `finally`-clear was never exercised, so its regression test
 *   passed with the clear deleted. A memo short-circuit above the in-flight
 *   check meant the second call never reached it.
 * - #1674: the `finally` deleted the key unconditionally, so a probe settling
 *   after a session reset evicted the REPLACEMENT probe a new session had
 *   already started for the same key.
 * - #1687: the trailing-rerun bit shipped unpinned — the test asserted "at most
 *   two passes" one-sidedly, which a coalescer that dropped the rerun entirely
 *   also satisfies.
 * - #1722: an inner latch was vacuous and its own mutation matrix deleted it.
 *
 * This module owns those four guards once. The API is the INTERSECTION of the
 * ten sites, not a superset: share, clear-in-finally, optional trailing-rerun
 * coalescing, optional generation check. Anything a single site needs stays at
 * that site.
 *
 * LIFECYCLE: the primitive owns no module state. `createSingleFlight` returns
 * a closure, so each registry's lifetime is its OWNER's — an instance field
 * lives as long as the instance, a module-level const as long as the process.
 * That keeps the session-state question where it belongs, at the owner, and
 * `clear()` is the seam an owner's reset calls. The two converted sites hold
 * instance fields, exactly as their `ensureInFlight` fields did, so neither
 * one's session-state answer changes.
 *
 * Teardown of a flight that never settles is the owner's question, and neither
 * converted site answers it today: a wedged probe holds its key until the
 * process ends, exactly as its `ensureInFlight` field did on master. This
 * primitive does not make that worse and does not fix it; an owner that needs a
 * deadline wraps `fn` in one before handing it over.
 *
 * The generation hook is deliberately thin — a `() => number` the primitive
 * reads at start and again at completion. The standalone generation-guard
 * primitive is #1754's; when it lands, this stays a callback and composes with
 * it rather than absorbing it.
