/**
 * Shared-checkout WIP guard (#2007).
 *
 * THE HAZARD. Several agent sessions can run against ONE checkout. Nothing
 * in git binds a session to a directory, so when one session runs
 * `git checkout <branch>`, git overwrites the tracked files another live
 * session was editing. The work is not recoverable: it was never committed
 * and never stashed. The reported incident lost uncommitted edits to three
 * files between two observations minutes apart.
 *
 * THE ANSWER IS REFUSAL, NOT RESCUE. An auto-stash would be invisible
 * machinery that moves another session's work somewhere it did not ask for,
 * and `git stash` is repo-global across worktrees, so the rescue would be a
 * second instance of the same defect. This guard instead DECLINES the
 * command and says who else is here. The operator resolves it the way the
 * design contract already says to: commit, or take a dedicated
 * `git worktree`.
 *
 * THREE FACTS MUST ALL HOLD BEFORE ANYTHING IS DECLINED, cheapest first:
 *
 *   1. The bash input really invokes a git verb that rewrites the working
 *      tree, read from git's own COMMAND POSITION. Pure string work, no I/O —
 *      see `WORKTREE_MUTATING_GIT_MATCHER`. The directory judged is the one
 *      the invocation TARGETS, which `-C` and `--work-tree` can move away
 *      from the caller's cwd.
 *   2. Another live pi-lens session is in the SAME WORKING TREE.
 *      `selectLivePeerInstances` (clients/instance-registry.ts) owns liveness
 *      and is the single source of truth for it; warm-attach reads the same
 *      predicate in `"exact"` mode. Path containment alone is not identity
 *      here, in either direction: a peer at the repo root and a command run
 *      from a subdirectory DO share one tree, while a linked worktree nested
 *      under the main checkout shares nothing with it. Containment against
 *      the toplevel is the pre-filter; `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` is the
 *      decision. No peer means nothing to protect.
 *   3. The working tree actually carries uncommitted work. A clean tree can
 *      be switched freely.
 *
 * That ordering is the cost story: the two `git` probes run only after a
 * genuine worktree-mutating command in a genuinely shared checkout, which is
 * rare. Ordinary bash traffic pays one string classification.
 *
 * UNKNOWN IS NOT CLEAN (catalog shape 10). When `git status` cannot answer,
 * the guard declines with its OWN reason rather than assuming the tree is
 * clean, and records a counted degradation so a repeatedly broken probe is
 * visible instead of silently permissive.
 *
 * The TOPLEVEL probes fail open, deliberately and asymmetrically to the
 * dirtiness probe: a candidate peer whose `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`
 * fails is dropped, and the allow record folds into `no_peer_session`; a cwd
 * whose probe fails folds into `not_a_git_worktree`. Both read as facts in
 * latency.log when they may be a timeout or a lock. Chosen because failing
 * closed here would let a broken probe block every branch switch; the cost is
 * that those two reasons are not distinguishable from the genuine cases.
 *
 * NO LATCHES HERE (catalog shape 17). Every decision is recomputed from the
 * registry and the tree. Repeat-suppression for telemetry lives in the
 * degradation ledger, which already re-arms at `session_start`.
