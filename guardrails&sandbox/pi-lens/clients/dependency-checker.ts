	/**
	 * Batch-check multiple files for circular deps in one turn-end pass,
	 * running the madge subprocess spawns concurrently (bounded by
	 * `MADGE_BATCH_CONCURRENCY`) instead of one at a time (#766).
	 *
	 * `lastCircular`/`circularFiles` are shared instance state that every madge
	 * run OVERWRITES wholesale, so ordering has to be pinned on two axes.
	 *
	 * WITHIN a batch — equivalence with the sequential `for…await
	 * checkFile(file)` loop this replaces:
	 *  - Classification (existence + `importsChanged`) runs synchronously in
	 *    original array order first — identical to what each sequential
	 *    `checkFile()` call would do, including the `importCache` side effect.
	 *  - Only the actual madge spawns for import-changed ("miss") files run
	 *    concurrently; each one's parsed result stays LOCAL (no shared-state
	 *    write) until every spawn has settled.
	 *  - The miss results are then folded in ORIGINAL array order (not
	 *    completion order) into a BATCH-LOCAL copy of the state, so each
	 *    cache-hit file's result reads the state as of its own position in the
	 *    array — byte-for-byte what the sequential last-write-wins loop
	 *    returned. The fold is synchronous, so the instance-state write is one
	 *    atomic assignment at the end; no concurrent spawn can interleave into
	 *    it, and the returned map is unaffected by whether that write survives
	 *    the rule below.
	 *
	 * ACROSS operations — newest classification wins:
	 *  - `checkFile`, `checkFilesBatch` and `scanProject` all write the same
	 *    shared state and genuinely overlap (turn-end vs. the background scans
	 *    in runtime-session and project-diagnostics/fresh-fetch). Each takes a
	 *    generation when it classifies, and `publishState` drops a write whose
	 *    generation is no longer the newest — so an operation that started
	 *    against OLDER file content cannot resurrect that view over a newer
	 *    operation that already published, whatever order the spawns finish in.
	 *  - ONLY the shared-state write is gated. Every per-file result handed back
	 *    to the caller is built from that file's own spawn output, so a dropped
	 *    publish never fabricates or hides a cycle for the caller.
	 *  - No result cache is introduced (#533, "when in doubt, re-run"): changed
	 *    content still re-runs madge every time, and the guard only skips writes
	 *    that a newest-wins sequential interleaving would also have discarded.
