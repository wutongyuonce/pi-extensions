/**
 * NDJSON telemetry log for diagnostic disposition marks (#690). Same shape as
 * clients/actionable-warnings-logger.ts: machine-global (getGlobalPiLensDir),
 * size-capped with a single `.log.1` backup, isTestMode no-op.
 *
 * Why a log at all: #181 identified false-positive marks flowing to telemetry
 * as THE highest-value rule-tuning signal — which shipped rules misfire, on
 * what tools, how often — and this is that hookup. The disposition store
 * itself is not enough: it keeps only the LATEST entry per anchor (a re-mark
 * overwrites), and `defer` marks never touch the store at all (in-memory by
 * design), so this log is the only durable trace of both re-mark history and
 * defer activity.
