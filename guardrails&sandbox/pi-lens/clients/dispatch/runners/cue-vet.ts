/**
 * `cue vet` — CUE evaluation-error validation (#1522).
 *
 * `cue lsp serve` reports load and parse (syntax) errors as you type
 * (`clients/lsp/wait-policy/strategies.ts`'s `cue` entry) but deliberately
 * leaves conflicting concrete values and failed constraints to `cue vet` —
 * per the CUE wiki, that class needs a full evaluation pass the language
 * server does not run on every keystroke. This runner is the auxiliary that
 * covers the gap, in the same "LSP covers syntax, a CLI covers the rest"
 * shape as terraform's `lsp, tflint, trivy-config` group.
 *
 * `-c=false` (allow incomplete values) is deliberate, not a shortcut: CUE's
 * default `cue vet` requires every regular field to be concrete, so an
 * ordinary schema-only file — a `#Definition` library with no concrete data,
 * a very common authoring pattern — fails vet's default gate with a generic
 * "some instances are incomplete" message and nothing to point at. That is
 * noise, not a defect. `-c=false` accepts incomplete values and still
 * reports a genuine type conflict (verified: `a: int & "hello"` still fails
 * with `-c=false`, an incomplete `a: int` no longer does) — see the fixture
 * at tests/fixtures/tool-smoke/cue-vet/bad.cue.
 *
 * ## Package-scoped, not file-scoped (review round 1, F1)
 *
 * CUE packages are DIRECTORY-scoped: every `.cue` file in a directory
 * sharing a `package` clause is unified into one value. Vetting only the
 * touched file (`cue vet <file>`) was a false-positive machine on the
 * normative split-schema/values authoring style — a `#Service` defined in
 * `schema.cue` and referenced from `values.cue` vets clean as a package but
 * fails `values.cue` alone with `reference "#Service" not found`, because
 * the single-file invocation never loads the sibling that defines it.
 * Verified: a valid two-file package vets clean as `cue vet -c=false .`
 * (exit 0, empty output) but reports a blocking error for `values.cue` in
 * isolation.
 *
 * The fix runs `cue vet -c=false .` from the touched file's directory (the
 * whole package) and then filters the reported errors down to the ones
 * whose location names the touched file — `cue vet`'s locations are
 * `.\<file>:line:col` relative to the vet cwd, so the match is a plain
 * basename compare, no path resolution needed.
 *
 * This is now an honest MISSED-finding tradeoff, not an invented-finding
 * bug: an error whose ONLY location is a sibling file is filtered out here
 * (it will surface when that sibling is itself touched), rather than a
 * clean file being wrongly flagged. An error that names the touched file
 * ANYWHERE in its location list — including as a secondary location on a
 * conflict whose primary site is a sibling — is kept, using that location's
 * line/col, because the touched file is a genuine contributor to it.
 *
 * ## Directory scope can itself be unavailable (review round 2, F5/F6)
 *
 * `cue vet .` is not always a valid unit. Two real, LEGAL directory shapes
 * make it fail before it evaluates anything, with no per-file location at
 * all:
 *
 *   - a package-less standalone file (no `package` clause — the common
 *     single-file config style): `build constraints exclude all CUE files
 *     in .:\n    .\standalone.cue: no package name`;
 *   - two or more DIFFERENT package names sharing one directory (legal CUE —
 *     each is its own independent unit): `found packages "alpha"
 *     (alpha.cue) and "beta" (beta.cue) in "."`.
 *
 * Both verified against cue v0.17.1 (exit 1, no `:line:col` anywhere in the
 * output). Before F5/F6, this read as an unattributable whole-vet failure
 * and blocked every edit to an otherwise-clean file of either shape — a
 * regression the F1 fix introduced. The fix: on either signature, fall back
 * to vetting the touched file ALONE (`cue vet -c=false <file>`), which is
 * the CORRECT scope for a file that cannot be unified with anything in its
 * directory — a package-less file is its own unit by definition, and a
 * differently-packaged sibling is never part of the same value regardless of
 * scope. The single-file result needs no further filtering: every location
 * it reports already belongs to that one file.
 *
 * ## A package-less file can vet CLEAN by never being evaluated (review
 * ## round 3, F8)
 *
 * The F5/F6 fallback above only fires when the DIRECTORY vet FAILS. But a
 * directory holding both a packaged file and a package-less file is not a
 * failure at all: `cue vet .` silently BUILDS ONLY THE PACKAGE, excludes the
 * package-less file from evaluation, and exits 0. Verified against the real
 * binary: a package-less `loose.cue` with a genuine conflicting value
 * (`b: int & "x"`) sitting beside a valid packaged `packaged.cue` makes
 * `cue vet -c=false .` exit 0 with empty output — the loose file's defect is
 * never evaluated, and the F5/F6 fallback's `result.status !== 0` gate never
 * triggers because there IS no failure to react to. This is shape 10 from
 * the miss side: an empty result that does not distinguish "clean" from
 * "never evaluated".
 *
 * The fix does not wait for a failure signal at all for this shape: before
 * spawning anything, the touched file's own content is checked for a
 * `package` clause (`hasPackageClause`). A package-less touched file goes
 * straight to single-file scope — it is its own vet unit regardless of what
 * shares its directory, so directory-scoped vet has nothing to add for ITS
 * evaluation errors. Its SYNTAX errors are equally covered single-file
 * (verified: `cue vet <file>` alone reports the identical syntax error a
 * directory-wide parse would have caught for that file — parsing happens
 * before the build-constraint exclusion, but a single-file invocation
 * parses that file too), so nothing is lost by skipping the directory pass
 * for this shape. The F5/F6 `directoryScopeUnavailable` fallback stays as a
 * safety net for what the proactive check cannot see up front — the
 * touched file's content is unreadable, or the touched file DOES declare a
 * package but the directory as a whole still isn't a valid unit (F6's
 * two-different-packages shape).
