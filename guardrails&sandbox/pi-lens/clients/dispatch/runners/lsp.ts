 * This runner's own dispatch wall-clock budget. `runRunner` in

 * against `runner.run()` for the WHOLE call — reading the file, waiting for
 * a client (bounded by `LSP_SPAWN_BUDGET_MS`, raised per-server via
 * `LSPServerInfo.clientWaitTimeoutMs`), then waiting for diagnostics
 * (`LSP_DIAGNOSTICS_WAIT_MS`).
 *
 * Left undeclared, this runner inherited the shared 30s default. A server
 * whose `clientWaitTimeoutMs` exceeds that — Prisma's 40s, Vue's 30s
 * (#2169, #2176) — could never actually use its own raised wait: the outer
 * race always fired first, at 30s, so raising a server's floor without also
 * raising this ceiling was a no-op on the real dispatch path (fix-round F2,
 * #2233). Derive the ceiling from the registry instead of a second
 * hand-picked literal, so the next slow server's `clientWaitTimeoutMs` keeps
 * this budget correct automatically: the highest declared
 * `clientWaitTimeoutMs` (or the shared 5s default, whichever is larger),
 * plus the diagnostics wait that still runs after a cold spawn succeeds,
 * plus a fixed margin.
 *
 * This raises the failure-detection latency for every OTHER language's
 * hung-server case too (30s -> the value below), not just the five servers
 * that need the headroom — the tradeoff is stated in PR #2233's body. It
 * remains well inside the spread other dispatch runners already use
 * (pyright 75s, golangci-lint/dotnet-build/rust-clippy 90s).
