/**
 * Redesigned Dispatch Types for pi-lens
 *
 * Key insight: Different clients have different OUTPUT SEMANTICS:
 * - BLOCKING: Errors that stop the agent (architect, lsp errors)
 * - WARNING: Non-blocking issues (biome warnings, type-safety)
 * - FIXABLE: Issues with auto-fix available
 * - SILENT: Metrics tracked but not shown (complexity)
 * - INFORMATIONAL: Shown in session summary only
 *
 * The dispatcher must handle these semantics consistently.

 * the waste. Use these three fields directly as map keys, fact keys, once-keys,
