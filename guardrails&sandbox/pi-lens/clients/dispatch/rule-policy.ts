/**
 * Project-level rule policy (`.pi-lens.json` `rules.<id>.disable` /
 * `rules.<id>.select`) — output-only filtering of dispatches, so the project's
 * own policy narrows what the user actually sees without widening the trusted
 * surface area (widget state, baseline, dedup, and per-edit record stay
 * authoritative).
 *
 * Matching is PROJECT-WIDE. The outer `rules.<key>` is a grouping label only —
 * it does not scope which diagnostics a `disable`/`select` list under it can
 * match. Every `disable` entry across every key is unioned into one drop list,
 * and every `select` entry across every key is unioned into one allowlist.
 * Disable is checked first, so it wins globally regardless of which key it's
 * configured under.
 *
 * Match normalization is consolidated with the rest of the rule-id surfaces:
 * `inline-suppressions.ts` and `lens-diagnostics.ts`'s `normalizeRuleId`
 * both strip the `ast-grep:` prefix and the `-js` suffix, so a user listing
 * `no-eval` once under `disable` covers both the LSP tag (`ast-grep:no-eval`)
 * and the napi tag (`no-eval` / `no-eval-js`). Sharing the normalization keeps
 * the three surfaces from drifting.
