/**
 * The single post-autofix instruction about a written file (#1590).
 *
 * Two layers used to phrase this. `clients/pipeline.ts` claimed "the attached
 * full content is authoritative" from changed-file membership alone, and
 * `clients/runtime-tool-result.ts` — the only layer that sees the per-file
 * attachment cap and the per-command aggregate budget — appended "too large to
 * attach" for the same file. On a size-capped write the agent got both.
 *
 * The wording now lives here, and `handleToolResult` is the only caller: the
 * pipeline supplies the data (display paths it already resolved) and the layer
 * that made the attachment decision picks the sentence. Keeping the renderer
 * out of `pipeline.ts` also keeps it real in tests that mock the pipeline away.
