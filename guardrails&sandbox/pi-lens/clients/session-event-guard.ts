/**
 * One home for "this event arrived on a ctx the SDK already invalidated"
 * (#1925).
 *
 * pi invalidates a captured extension ctx when the session is replaced —
 * `ctx.newSession()`, `ctx.fork()`, `ctx.switchSession()`, `ctx.reload()`.
 * Every accessor on that ctx then throws from the SDK's `assertActive()`
 * (`core/extensions/loader.js` in the installed
 * `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent`). An event already queued when the swap
 * happens still reaches pi-lens, carrying the dead ctx, and the first
 * unguarded `ctx.signal` / `ctx.ui` / `ctx.cwd` read throws.
 *
 * That throw does not escape into pi's loop. `ExtensionRunner.emit` wraps every
 * handler call in a try/catch and routes the error to `emitError`
 * (`core/extensions/runner.js:586-606` in the installed SDK), so the throw
 * surfaces as an extension error report against pi-lens. The report names the
 * wrong cause. It reads as a pi-lens handler bug when the real event is a
 * benign race with a session swap, it says nothing about which handler keeps
 * losing, and it counts nothing. This wrapper converts that noisy misattributed
 * error into a counted, bounded, attributable skip.
 *
 * #1924 fixed that for `agent_settled` with an inline try/catch. #1925 found
 * four more handlers with the same shape. Five inline copies of one policy is
 * the parallel-state defect AGENTS.md names, so the policy lives here instead.
 * `agent_settled` is a consumer of this path, not a special case.
 *
 * ## What this module actually covers
 *
 * Not every `pi.on` registration in `index.ts` goes through here, and the doc
 * used to read as if they all did. Seven do today:
 *
 * - {@link wrapSessionEventHandler} — `tool_result`, `turn_start`,
 *   `agent_end`, `turn_end`, `agent_settled` (#1925) and `session_start`
 *   (#1929). All six return nothing, so a skipped event resolving to
 *   `undefined` is exactly their own early-exit value.
 * - {@link wrapSessionEventHandlerWithResult} — `context` (#1929), which must
 *   hand the host back a message list on the live path.
 *
 * Five registrations stay unwrapped on purpose: `resources_discover`,
 * `session_before_fork`, `tool_call`, `session_shutdown`, and `message_end`.
 * `tests/clients/session-event-guard-sweep.test.ts` is the source of truth for
 * that split. It scans every registration in `index.ts` and reds unless the
 * handler is wrapped or carries a written reason, so this paragraph can go
 * stale but the contract cannot.
 *
 * The wrapper does three things and nothing else:
 *
 * 1. **Probes once, before dispatch.** {@link probeCtxActive} answers `false`
 *    only when an `assertActive()`-wrapped accessor threw the SDK's own stale
 *    message. `undefined` (no ctx, unexpected shape, unrecognised throw) is
 *    inconclusive and always dispatches — never guess a session dead.
 * 2. **Still classifies a stale throw that races in mid-handler.** The probe
 *    is a point-in-time read; the swap can land between the probe and the
 *    handler's own first ctx read, and for an async handler it can land at any
 *    await. Both the synchronous throw and the rejected promise are
 *    classified by {@link isStaleExtensionCtxError}.
 * 3. **Makes the skip visible.** One bounded record and one ledger kind for
 *    the whole class, keyed by the event name so aggregation still answers
 *    WHICH handler is being skipped. A silent guard and a guard that never
 *    fires read identically from a log, which is exactly how vacuous guards
 *    survive review.
 *
 * Anything that is NOT the SDK's stale-ctx error propagates unchanged. The
 * wrapper narrows nothing else: a handler bug must stay as loud as it was.
