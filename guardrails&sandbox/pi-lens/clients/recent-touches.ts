/**
 * Cross-process touched-files record (#492).
 *
 * #485 (clients/agent-nudge.ts) delivers an inline "these files were
 * autoformatted by pi-lens" context nudge, fed by the IN-PROCESS
 * `pilens:files:touched` bus event (#482, clients/bus-publish.ts). That
 * covers every run/turn of the SAME pi process, but subagents spawn real
 * child `pi` processes — a separate process, a separate in-memory bus, a
 * separate accumulator. Nothing about #485 crosses that boundary in either
 * direction:
 *
 *   - Child blind to parent: parent's turn_end autoformat dirties the tree;
 *     a child asked to commit runs `git status`, finds unexplained `M`
 *     files, burns turns investigating.
 *   - Parent blind to child: the child is ephemeral, but the parent keeps
 *     working in the same tree after the child returns and its pi-lens
 *     autoformatted on top of the child's edits.
 *
 * This module is the shared substrate: a single project-scoped
 * `recent-touches.json` (via `getProjectDataDir(cwd)` — NEVER a hardcoded
 * `.pi-lens` path) that every pi-lens instance (parent or child) both
 * appends to (on publish) and reads from (session_start / turn_start). Ring
 * buffer capped at ~50 entries; atomic tmp+rename writes, same pattern as
 * the instance registry (#474, clients/instance-registry.ts). `pid` is what
 * makes consumption self-excluding: a process must never see its own writes
 * come back around as a "cross-process" nudge.
 *
 * Non-goals (#492): no IPC, no daemon, no `fs.watch` — a passive file,
 * appended on publish and read at session_start / mtime-gated at
 * turn_start. Not a general cross-process event bus; one record for one
 * nudge feed.
