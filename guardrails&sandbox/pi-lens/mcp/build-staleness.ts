/**
 * Warm-server build-staleness detection (#535).
 *
 * The MCP server is long-lived (weeks, per #514/#256's warm/fresh doctrine) —
 * it loads its code ONCE at process start and never re-reads disk. A
 * `npm run build:dist` or a `git merge` that changes `dist/mcp/server.js` (or
 * the in-place `mcp/server.js` during dev) never reaches an already-running
 * warm server: it keeps serving the OLD schema/logic indefinitely. Dogfooding
 * #517 caught this live — a post-#517 rebuild still answered with the
 * pre-#517 `pilens_module_report` shape. That is the "plausible-but-wrong"
 * failure mode the #240/#511 honesty doctrine exists to prevent, not a mere
 * error — so the warm boundary must detect it and say so, never silently
 * serve stale.
 *
 * Design: capture an mtime "stamp" of the server's own entry file at process
 * start (module-level, once). On each call at the warm boundary, cheaply
 * re-stat the SAME file and compare. A full content hash was considered and
 * rejected for the hot path — mtime already changes on any rebuild/checkout
 * that touches the file (build tools + git both update it), and hashing the
 * whole bundle on every tool call is needless I/O; mtime is the same signal
 * class the #492 cross-process reader already trusts for freshness.
 *
 Pure/testable: `computeBuildStamp`/`checkStaleness` take an injectable stat
 * function so tests never touch the real filesystem or a real build.
 *
 * Throttle: re-stating on EVERY call would still be one syscall per call —
 * cheap, but under a tool-call burst (e.g. a batch of `pilens_symbol_search`)
 * that's needless repeated I/O for a condition that changes at most once per
 * rebuild. `StalenessGate` re-stats at most once per `checkIntervalMs`
 * (default 1000ms, matching the #492 precedent's "cheap per-call check, not
 * per-call I/O" shape) and reuses the last verdict in between.
