// Kept separate from the CLI so the log-reading heuristics and the
// once-per-sequential-invocation rerun guard are unit-testable without a
// GitHub event or a network call (the check-pr-title.mjs /
// merge-train-warden.mjs pattern). The guard does not serialize CONCURRENT
// invocations -- see the REAL SCOPE note on shouldTriggerRerun (review
// round 2, V2/V3) for exactly what is and isn't guaranteed under
// concurrency.
//
// The problem this solves is not the OOM itself, it is the JUDGMENT cost: the
// 2026-08-25/26 merge train paid a manual log read and a judged rerun for
// every exit-137 kill, even though most of them carry zero failing
// assertions and are indistinguishable infrastructure noise (#2042). This
// module turns "read the log, decide" into a function a human or an
// orchestrator can call on a run id.

 * The once-per-SHA rerun guard. A real failure is never rerun, full stop.
 * An infra classification is rerun-eligible UNLESS the PR's current

 * SHA -- a different SHA (a new push) always gets to try again, because the
 * guard's job is "don't loop on the same commit", not "never rerun this PR
 * again". Review round 1, F4: a marker of "failed:<status>" (the rerun API
 * call itself failed) is NOT "already triggered" -- it must remain eligible
 * so the next invocation can retry.
 *
 * REAL SCOPE OF THE "ONCE PER SHA" GUARANTEE (review round 2, V2/V3 --
 * measured, not assumed): this guard serializes SEQUENTIAL invocations
 * against one PR's comment history. It does NOT serialize CONCURRENT
 * invocations -- there is no lock around "read the marker, then rerun".
 * Two known, accepted ways the guarantee can still under- or over-fire:
 *
 *   V2: N concurrent invocations for the same SHA can all read the SAME
 *   "not yet triggered" marker state before any of them writes, so all N
 *   attempt the rerun POST (measured: 3 concurrent invocations -> 3 rerun
 *   calls). This is accepted, not serialized: GitHub's own
 *   rerun-failed-jobs answers a duplicate rerun on an already-
 *   queued/in-progress run with 403, which attemptRerun records as
 *   `failed:403` -- a losing invocation's marker write (if it wins the
 *   comment race) or the next sequential invocation's read both see an
 *   honest failure record, not a false "never happened". The guarantee
 *   this code actually provides is "once per SEQUENTIAL invocation", not
 *   "once across any concurrency".
 *
 *   V3: the attempt-then-record order (F4) fixed "the marker lies", but it
 *   opens a narrower window: if the rerun POST succeeds and the FOLLOWING
 *   comment POST fails (a separate network call, after the rerun already
 *   fired), this invocation throws having already triggered a real rerun
 *   with no marker recorded. The next invocation finds no comment, so it
 *   reruns again (measured: 2 total reruns across 2 sequential attempts
 *   with an injected comment-POST failure). Judged the right trade against
 *   the alternative (recording the marker BEFORE the attempt, which lies
 *   whenever the attempt itself fails, per F4) -- an extra rerun is
 *   wasteful, a permanently-blocked SHA is worse.
 *
 * Neither gap is silent: every attempt, successful or not, is recorded in
 * SOME comment (this invocation's own, or a later reconciled one), and a
 * duplicate rerun is GitHub's own no-op, not a runaway loop.
