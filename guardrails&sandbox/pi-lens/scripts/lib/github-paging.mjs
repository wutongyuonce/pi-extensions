/**
 * Bounded REST paging for the merge-train scripts (review round 1, F6).
 *
 * The marker-based comment dedupe in both the warden and the merge lane read
 * only the FIRST page of `issues/{n}/comments`, so a PR past 100 comments
 * would stop finding its own marker and start repeating notices.
 *
 * `sort=created&direction=desc` does NOT help: probed 2026-08-26 against
 * `repos/apmantza/pi-lens/issues/2109/comments`, `direction=desc` and
 * `direction=asc` returned the identical ascending list, so the endpoint
 * ignores the parameter (AGENTS.md shape 16 -- verify the API's real
 * behaviour, do not trust the doc). Newest-first is therefore unavailable and
 * the reader must walk to the last page.
 *
 * The walk is bounded like the warden's GraphQL reader: it stops at
 * MAX_REST_PAGES and reports truncation rather than looping, and a truncated
 * read is never reported as a complete one.
