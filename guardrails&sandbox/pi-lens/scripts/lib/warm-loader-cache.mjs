/**
 * Pure helpers for `scripts/warm-loader-cache.mjs` (#1926).
 *
 * pi loads an extension through jiti (`createJiti(..., { moduleCache: false,
 * alias: … })` in `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent`'s
 * `dist/core/extensions/loader.js`). jiti transforms the entry with Babel and
 * stores the result in a filesystem cache. pi-lens's `dist/index.js` is a ~4MB
 * esbuild bundle, so that transform costs seconds: the first session after a
 * `git:` install or update measured 4847ms of `module import`, against a 138ms
 * steady state once the cache is warm (#1926 field report).
 *
 * The fix is to pay that transform at install time instead of in the first
 * interactive session. `prepare` already builds `dist/`, so the last step of
 * the chain runs the same transform through the same jiti, writing the same
 * cache file pi will later read.
 *
 * WHY THE WARM PRODUCES A HIT FOR THE REAL LOADER
 *
 * jiti keys a cache entry on the transformed file, not on the jiti instance
 * (see `getCache` in `jiti/dist/jiti.cjs`):
 *
 *   <basename(dirname(file))>-<basename(file) up to the first dot>
 *   + "+map" if sourceMaps + ".i" if interopDefault
 *   + "." + md5(file).slice(0, 8)
 *   + ".mjs" for an async import, ".cjs" otherwise
 *
 * and it validates the stored body against a trailing
 * ` /* v<TRANSFORM_VERSION>-<md5(source).slice(0,16)> *\/` marker. So the warm
 * has to agree with pi on three things only: the absolute path of the entry,
 * the cache directory, and the transform itself. Everything else — the alias
 * map, `moduleCache`, which package the jiti instance was created from — is
 * outside the key AND outside the transform. Measured, not assumed: running
 * this warm over the dogfood install's `dist/index.js` produced a cache file
 * byte-identical to the one pi had written, both with pi's alias map and with
 * no alias map at all.
 *
 * The marker is also the safety net. If pi ships a jiti whose transform version
 * or Babel output differs, pi recomputes the marker, does not match, and simply
 * re-transforms. A mismatched warm costs the install a few seconds and buys
 * nothing; it can never hand pi the wrong code.

/**
 * Did the warm actually leave a cache entry pi can use?
 *
 * Elapsed time is not evidence. jiti can return from an import having written
 * nothing, and every such path exits 0:
 *
 *   - the cache directory is not writable. jiti's `prepareCacheDir` catches
 *     that, sets `fsCache` to false, and transforms in memory from then on.
 *   - the entry imported natively and nothing needed transforming. For an
 *     async-imported ESM `.js` file jiti's `evalModule` attempts a native
 *     import UNCONDITIONALLY, and only falls back to the transform when that
 *     import rejects. So the cache exists at all because native import fails in
 *     a real `--omit=dev` install, where the host-provided specifiers do not
 *     resolve. That is the same reason pi's own load transforms the bundle,
 *     which is why the warm and pi agree — but it is a property of the
 *     environment, not of this script.
 *   - a cache entry exists but does not match the source. jiti validates the
 *     body against a trailing version-and-source-hash marker, so a stale or
 *     truncated file is a miss for pi and the session pays the transform.
 *
 * Checking the file is what turns "the import returned" into "the warm's own
 * jiti cached this entry, with these versions". It is not a promise about pi:
 * pi-side drift shows up as a version delta between this record and pi's, which
 * is a thing to read from the log, not something an install can detect.
 * An absent entry always warrants a look, never a shrug.
