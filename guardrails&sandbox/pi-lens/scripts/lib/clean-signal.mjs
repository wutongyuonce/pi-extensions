// Pure classifier for the clean-signal probe (scripts/probe-clean-signal.mjs).
//
// Splits a PUSH-mode LSP server's clean-scan behavior along TWO axes that must
// not be collapsed (#460 review):
//   - LATENCY axis (does the wait early-return?): pi-lens's publishDiagnostics
//     handler (clients/lsp/client.ts) bumps its INTERNAL diagnosticsVersion and
//     emits on EVERY publish — versioned or not — and waitForDiagnostics
//     early-returns on that emit. So ANY publish on a clean transition resolves
//     the wait; only true SILENCE is budget-bound (the #458 learned-deadline
//     target set).
//   - CURRENCY-PROOF axis (can the publish be tied to the live edit?): the
//     LSP-reported doc version (diagnosticDocVersions) is used only to REJECT
//     provably-lagging results; a version-less publish cannot be proven stale,
//     so it is ACCEPTED as fresh. Version-less publishes therefore early-return
//     fine but carry a weaker staleness guarantee (temporal correlation, not
//     proof) — a staleness-RISK note, not a latency cost.
//
// Hence the 4-way, PHASE-AWARE classification (the dirty touch proves liveness;
// the clean-transition touches are the discriminator):
//   - publishes-versioned   (tier 2 ): publishes WITH version on clean
//     transitions — affirmative + currency-proven (ast-grep).
//   - publishes-unversioned (tier 2*): publishes version-lessly on clean
//     transitions — early-returns the wait at runtime, currency only temporally
//     correlated (opengrep).
//   - silent                (tier 3 ): demonstrably alive (published on dirty)
//     but demonstrably silent on clean transitions — the budget-wait case and
//     the #458 target.
//   - unknown               (tier — ): no publish at all (slow/absent —
//     conservatively not classified).
//
// Kept as a side-effect-free function so it can be unit-tested without spawning
// a server (see tests/scripts/clean-signal.test.ts). #240/#460.

// must never be treated as evidence of anything, so it never drifts (only
// `silent` vs a `publishes-*` result is comparable to the boolean marker).
