/**
 * Merge-train warden (#1844): the mechanical version of the checks a human

 * open PRs for merge conflicts, stale auto-merge, and red required checks.
 *
 * The warden OBSERVES AND ANNOTATES ONLY. It never resolves conflicts,
 * never merges, and never pushes to a PR branch. Two exceptions, both
 * GitHub-sanctioned buttons a human clicks in the UI:
 *
 * - "update branch" for a PR that already has auto-merge armed and has
 *   fallen BEHIND.
 * - "re-run workflow" for a run this sweep classified as STARVED (#2184) --
 *   at most once per run, keyed on GitHub's own `run_attempt` counter.
 *
 * Merging stays out of this file by construction; the label-gated merge lane
 * lives in scripts/lib/merge-train-lane.mjs with its own workflow and its own
 * permissions (#2185).
