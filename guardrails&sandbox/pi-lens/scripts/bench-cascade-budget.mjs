/**
 * Cascade neighbour-budget sizing bench (#1462).
 *
 * Replays the 2026-08-15 dogfood cascade timings through the real derivation in
 * `clients/cascade-budget.js` and reports, per scenario, what the walk costs
 * under the flat 40-neighbour cap versus the derived budget.
 *
 * TWO DIFFERENT COSTS, deliberately independent:
 *
 *   --divisor-ms      what PRODUCTION divides by (`PI_LENS_CASCADE_NEIGHBOUR_
 *                     COST_MS`, default 100). An estimate.
 *   --true-cost-ms    what a neighbour ACTUALLY costs in this run of the model.
 *
 * Feeding one number into both makes "the derived walk fits" an arithmetic
 * identity that holds at any value and proves nothing. Holding the divisor at
 * the production estimate and sweeping the true cost is the falsifiable form:
 * it shows the band where the rescue works and the point where the estimate is
 * wrong enough that the walk overruns anyway. `--sweep` runs that sweep.
 *
 * The walk cost is a MODEL, not a fresh measurement: touches fan out in
 * parallel, so the number that matters is the marginal wall-clock cost of one
 * more neighbour under LSP contention. 97 ms is the issue's own measurement
 * (3.88 s at nbr=40, 3.71 s at nbr=38). Preludes include work before turn_end
 * and are the measured graph-build / reverse-deps times from the same window.
 * `--turn-end-gap-ms` controls the pre-turn gap that is outside the settle
 * deadline and therefore is not charged against the on-time window.
 *
 * "Dropped" is the column that matters against a narrowed budget: a neighbour
 * cut by the budget is gone for good, while a neighbour on a LATE run is not —
 * `settleCascadeRuns` re-parks the promise, `cascade_carry_over_settle` drains
 * it at agent_settled, and `beginTurn` keeps it pending until it resolves.
 *
 * Usage: npm run bench:cascade-budget [-- --sweep --divisor-ms=100 --true-cost-ms=97]
