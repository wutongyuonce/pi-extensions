/**
 * pi_lens_activate_tools — the loader tool that bootstraps pi's dynamic
 * tooling (registered-but-inactive tools activated via `pi.setActiveTools`).
 *
 * A handful of pi-lens tools are situational (structural ast-grep
 * search/replace/outline/dump, LSP go-to-definition/references/rename) —
 * useful on many turns, but not every turn. On hosts that support it, pi
 * lets an extension register such tools inactive and expose a small
 * always-active loader the model calls to activate a subset by name
 * (docs: https://github.com/earendil-works/pi, packages/coding-agent/docs/
 * extensions.md, "Dynamic Tool Loading"). Newly activated tools appear
 * starting the NEXT turn — no reload needed.
 *
 * This tool stays always-active (it has to, to bootstrap activation). It is
 * a no-op catalog lookup on hosts where the caller never wired
 * `setActiveTools`/`getActiveTools` (see the feature-detected gating in
 * index.ts) — the situational tools are registered statically active there
 * instead, so calling this tool is harmless, just unnecessary.
