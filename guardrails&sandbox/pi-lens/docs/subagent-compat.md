# Subagent-extension compatibility (#476)

pi-lens's subagent-compatibility features — #475 (subagent light mode), #474
(instance registry + orphan LSP reaper), and #473 (concurrent-session guard) —
were all built on **reverse-engineered facts** about two third-party pi
extensions and the pi SDK itself. Nobody has promised us these stay true
across their releases. This doc records exactly what we depend on, where, and
how the nightly `compat-smoke` workflow (`.github/workflows/compat-smoke.yml`)
verifies it. See issue #476 for the design rationale.

## Pinned contracts

Versions below are what was installed and verified while building this smoke
(2026-07). Re-verify against current versions any time the nightly alerts —
`scripts/compat-contracts.mjs` prints the versions it actually installed on
every run.

| # | Contract | Depended on by | Third-party file (as of the versions below) | Verified against |
|---|----------|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| 1 | `PI_SUBAGENT_CHILD` is set to the literal string `"1"` in every spawned child's env; `PI_SUBAGENT_RUN_ID` / `PI_SUBAGENT_CHILD_AGENT` are set alongside it for best-effort identity. | `clients/subagent-mode.ts` (`isSubagentSession()`, `getSubagentIdentity()`) | `pi-subagents@0.34.0` — `src/runs/shared/pi-args.ts` (`SUBAGENT_CHILD_ENV`/`SUBAGENT_RUN_ID_ENV`/`SUBAGENT_CHILD_AGENT_ENV` consts + the `env[SUBAGENT_CHILD_ENV] = "1"` assignment) | `checkNicobailonChildEnv` |
| 1b | avtc-pi-subagent sets `PI_SUBAGENT_CHILD_AGENT` + `PI_SUBAGENT_PARENT_PID` (never `PI_SUBAGENT_CHILD`) on the per-spawn subagent env; `isSubagentSession()` treats the PAIR (both non-empty) as an additional subagent signal (#507). | `clients/subagent-mode.ts` (`isSubagentSession()`, `getSubagentIdentity()`) | `avtc-pi-subagent@1.0.3` — `src/process-runner.ts` (`subagentEnv.PI_SUBAGENT_CHILD_AGENT = agent.name` + `subagentEnv.PI_SUBAGENT_PARENT_PID = String(process.pid)`) | `checkAvtcChildEnv` |
| 2a | The pi SDK's extension loader keeps a **process-global** cache (`extensionCache = new Map()`). This is what makes an in-process `bindExtensions()` reuse pi-lens's own module-scope singletons instead of a fresh isolated instance. | `clients/session-lifecycle.ts` (the whole premise of the concurrent-session guard) | `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent@0.80.6` — `dist/core/extensions/loader.js` | `checkSdkExtensionCache` |
| 2b | `AgentSession.bindExtensions()` **unconditionally** emits a `session_start`-typed event (`this._extensionRunner.emit(this._sessionStartEvent)`). | Same as 2a — this is why an in-process subagent bind re-triggers pi-lens's `session_start` handler at all. | `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent@0.80.6` — `dist/core/agent-session.js` (`bindExtensions()`, ~line 1717) | `checkSdkBindExtensionsEmitsSessionStart` |
| 2c | `_extensionRunner.invalidate(...)` is called from the sequential session-replacement path (`newSession`/`fork`/`switchSession`/`reload`'s dispose route), never from a concurrent sibling bind. | `clients/session-lifecycle.ts` (`probeCtxActive()` — the asymmetry this whole guard relies on) | `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent@0.80.6` — `dist/core/agent-session.js` (~line 551) | `checkSdkInvalidateCalled` |
| 2d | The stale-ctx error thrown by an invalidated context's accessors contains the literal fragment `"stale after session replacement"`. | `clients/session-lifecycle.ts` (`probeCtxActive()` matches on this exact fragment) | `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent@0.80.6` — `dist/core/agent-session.js` (the `invalidate(...)` message string) | `checkSdkStaleCtxMessage` |
| 3 | tintinweb's subagent runner constructs a `DefaultResourceLoader` and calls `session.bindExtensions(...)` on a freshly created `AgentSession`, **inside the same Node process** as the parent pi session. | `clients/session-lifecycle.ts` (the concurrent-secondary case #473 exists to protect against) | `@tintinweb/pi-subagents@0.13.0` — `src/agent-runner.ts` (`new DefaultResourceLoader({...})` ~line 433, `await session.bindExtensions({...})` ~line 597) | `checkTintinwebInProcessBind` |

All seven checks live in `scripts/lib/compat-contracts.mjs` as pure,
unit-tested regex matchers against RESILIENT semantic shapes (never a line
number — those drift on every third-party release). `scripts/compat-contracts.mjs`
is the orchestration script: it `npm install`s the four packages (SDK,
`pi-subagents`, `avtc-pi-subagent`, `@tintinweb/pi-subagents`) into a scratch
directory, reads the specific files above, and runs every check.

## The three env levers

| Env var | Default | Effect |
|---------|---------|--------|
| `PI_LENS_SUBAGENT_FULL` | unset (light mode auto-detects) | Set to `1` to force full (non-light) behavior even inside a detected subagent child session — nicobailon/pi-subagents (`PI_SUBAGENT_CHILD=1`) or avtc-pi-subagent (`PI_SUBAGENT_CHILD_AGENT` + `PI_SUBAGENT_PARENT_PID` pair, #507) — disables the light-mode heavyweight-scan skip for either vocabulary. |
| `PI_LENS_CONCURRENT_SESSION_GUARD` | unset (guard enabled) | Set to `0` to disable the #473 concurrent-session guard entirely — every `session_start` classifies as sequential replacement (pre-#473 behavior: a concurrent in-process bind would run the full reset, tearing down the parent's live LSP fleet). |
| `PI_LENS_INSTANCE_REGISTRY` | unset (registry enabled) | Set to `0` to disable the #474 cross-process instance registry — no orphan-LSP reaping happens at `session_start`, but also no new risk (registry writes are best-effort and already fail open). |

## What each smoke layer asserts

### Layer A — pinned-contract verification (`scripts/compat-contracts.mjs`)

No `pi` process, no LLM turn. Installs the real packages (table above) and
mechanically re-checks all six contracts against the installed source. Exit
0 = all pass; exit 1 = at least one contract check failed (real drift); exit
2 = infrastructure failure (npm install of the third-party packages itself
failed — usually a registry/network issue, not a contract regression).

### Layer B — real-pi behavioral smoke (`scripts/compat-smoke-behavioral.mjs`)

Installs the packed pi-lens tarball into a real `pi` (the same "pi-load"
mechanism `.github/workflows/install-smoke.yml` already uses) and drives
`pi --mode rpc` so `session_start` fires and pi-lens loads — no LLM turn
needed, matching `scripts/rpc-load-check.mjs`'s no-model-required design.

**Every invocation sets `PI_LENS_STARTUP_MODE=full`.** pi-lens's
cold-start-quick optimization (see AGENTS.md "Session-start critical path")
forces the *first* `session_start` of any process onto the fast "quick"
path regardless of `--print` — that path returns before the subagent-light
-mode check (and the heavyweight-scan skip it gates) ever runs. This was
confirmed empirically while building this smoke: without the override, the
"quick mode active" line appears in `sessionstart.log` and no
`subagent_light_mode` phase is ever logged, producing a false negative. With
`PI_LENS_STARTUP_MODE=full`, the phase logs deterministically on the very
first session.

Assertions:

1. **Subagent light mode engages** — with `PI_SUBAGENT_CHILD=1` set,
   `subagent_light_mode` is logged to `~/.pi-lens/latency.log` (a `type:
   "phase"` entry) and none of the seven heavyweight-scan phases
   (`knip`/`jscpd`/`madge`/`dead-code`/`govulncheck`/`gitleaks`/`trivy`) are
   logged for that run.
2. **`PI_LENS_SUBAGENT_FULL=1` overrides it off** — with both
   `PI_SUBAGENT_CHILD=1` and `PI_LENS_SUBAGENT_FULL=1` set, no
   `subagent_light_mode` phase is logged for that run.
3. **Zero surviving LSP-server processes after a clean exit** — pi is asked
   to shut down gracefully (closing its RPC stdin, which pi's own RPC mode
   treats as a shutdown trigger — NOT a `SIGKILL`, which would skip
   `session_shutdown` and make this assertion meaningless). A grace period
   (a few seconds) is given for the async teardown
   (`session_shutdown` → LSP fast teardown → child `SIGTERM`) to complete,
   then the process table is diffed against a pre-run snapshot for any
   *new* process whose command line matches a narrow LSP-server marker list
   (`typescript-language-server`, `ast-grep lsp`, `pyright-langserver`, …,
   `scripts/lib/process-scan.mjs`). This is the #472 orphan class #474
   fixed.
4. **avtc-pi-subagent PAIR engages light mode** (#507/#518) — with only
   `PI_SUBAGENT_CHILD_AGENT` + `PI_SUBAGENT_PARENT_PID` set (no
   `PI_SUBAGENT_CHILD`), `subagent_light_mode` is logged and none of the
   seven heavyweight-scan phases are — same detection as assertion 1,
   exercised through the second vocabulary.
5. **avtc-pi-subagent LONE var does NOT engage light mode** (#507/#518) — the
   inverse guard: with only `PI_SUBAGENT_CHILD_AGENT` set (no
   `PI_SUBAGENT_PARENT_PID`), no `subagent_light_mode` phase is logged.
   `subagent-mode.ts`'s doc comment requires the PAIR — a lone var set by
   some unrelated tool must not trigger light mode.
6. **`concurrent_session_bind` (#473) and its `concurrent_session_bind_rollup`
   session-end summary (#2249) — NOT asserted, documented TODO.**
   The guard is fully wired on master (PR #477): `index.ts`'s `session_start`
   handler calls `decideSessionStart()` and logs a `concurrent_session_bind`
   latency phase for a concurrent-secondary bind — so the phase exists to
   observe. `clients/session-start-observability.ts` also keeps a bounded,
   process-singleton-backed tally of declined binds by classification
   (`concurrent-secondary` / `secondary-root`), which `index.ts`'s
   `session_shutdown` handler logs as one `concurrent_session_bind_rollup`
   row (primary sessions only) and clears — same primary-only placement as
   `session_end_bus_rollup`/`path_attribution_verified_rollup`. The blocker is
   DRIVING either keylessly: reproducing tintinweb's in-process model for real
   (mirroring `agent-runner.ts`'s `createAgentSession()` +
   `DefaultResourceLoader` + `bindExtensions()` sequence) requires full
   session construction, which in turn needs model/provider config — not
   cheaply stubbable without a real model key, and #476 explicitly asks not
   to ship something flaky here. The unit + behavioral coverage in
   `tests/clients/session-lifecycle.test.ts` guards the classifier and the
   no-reset contract, and `tests/clients/session-start-observability.test.ts`
   plus `tests/index-integration.test.ts` guard the rollup's counting,
   process-singleton survival, and primary-only reset/emit wiring, all
   in-repo; what Layer B cannot yet add is the end-to-end SDK-driven variant.
   **Revisit if the pi SDK grows a model-free session constructor or stub
   provider** — at that point add a Layer B assertion analogous to 1-3
   checking the `concurrent_session_bind`/`concurrent_session_bind_rollup`
   phases and the absence of a second LSP fleet teardown.

## What to do when the nightly alerts

`compat-smoke.yml` never reds itself on a contract/behavioral failure — both
layers run under `continue-on-error: true`. Instead, a failure opens (or
refreshes the body of) a single tracking issue titled **"compat-smoke:
third-party contract drift detected"** — search for it by title before
assuming a NEW investigation is needed; the workflow already
create-or-updates it, never duplicates.

1. Read the linked run log — both layers print a `[PASS]`/`[FAIL]` line per
   check with a one-line detail on exactly what didn't match.
2. Find the failed check's row in the pinned-contracts table above and go
   read the current third-party source at the referenced file — a Layer A
   failure means the semantic shape genuinely changed upstream (a renamed
   env var, a moved `emit()` call, a reworded error message, ...).
3. Update the corresponding matcher in `scripts/lib/compat-contracts.mjs`
   (and its test in `tests/scripts/compat-contracts.test.ts`) to match the
   new shape, update the pinned-contracts table's version/line reference
   above, and fix whichever pi-lens module (`subagent-mode.ts` /
   `session-lifecycle.ts` / `instance-reaper.ts`) actually depended on the
   old shape if the drift broke real behavior — not just the check.
4. A Layer B failure (an assertion, not an infra error) means real pi-lens
   behavior regressed under a real `pi` — treat it like any other bug: write
   a fixture-level test if the gap wasn't otherwise covered, then fix.
5. Close the tracking issue once the underlying check is green again — it
   will reopen (well, get a fresh create — see the note in the issue body
   about not manually closing while still failing) if it recurs.

## Known-extension assessments (no contract pinned)

Extensions assessed against the #473/#474/#475 interaction surfaces and found
to need NO nightly contract check. Recorded so nobody re-derives this; re-assess
if their execution model visibly changes.

### plannotator (`@plannotator/pi-extension`, assessed 2026-07-10 at ~v0.22)

Browser-based plan/review UI; ~30k npm downloads/mo. **Benign coexistence.**
Never binds an `AgentSession` in-process (#473 class N/A) and never spawns
child `pi`s at session start (#475 class N/A). Namespaces fully disjoint
(`PLANNOTATOR_*`, `~/.pi/plannotator*.json`). Its planning-phase `tool_call`
blocking coexists additively with the read-guard (either may block; plan files
are newly-created so never trip `zero_read`). Two second-order notes: (a) its
own spawned agent jobs are cleaned up via `process.once("exit")` — its own
#472-class orphan risk on hard kills, internal to plannotator (our reaper
cleans pi-lens's servers inside any orphaned child `pi` it leaves); (b) its
on-demand "run agent: pi" jobs spawn child pis WITHOUT a subagent marker, so
pi-lens runs at full weight there — low-frequency, user-triggered, accepted.

### pi-dynamic-workflows (`@quintinshaw/pi-dynamic-workflows`, assessed 2026-07-10 at v2.12.0)

vm-sandboxed orchestration scripts fanning out to up to 16 in-process
subagents. **Benign coexistence via a THIRD execution model**: it calls
`createAgentSession()` directly and never `bindExtensions()`/`reload()` — the
only two SDK paths that emit `session_start` — so pi-lens's handler never runs
for its subagents. No #473 hazard by construction; no #475 child processes; no
#472 kills (disposal via `session.dispose()` in `finally`); zero namespace
overlap (`~/.pi/workflows/`).

**Known gap, by their design, not a bug**: because pi-lens never binds into
those subagent sessions, subagent-written edits get NO pi-lens diagnostics,
read-guard, or dispatch — pi-lens is a bystander until the parent session
touches the files. Worktree-isolated agents (`.pi/worktrees/<slug>`) are
additionally out of the parent's project scope. If a user reports "pi-lens
didn't catch X in my workflow run", this is why.

### pi-subagents-worktrees (`@gotgenes/pi-subagents` + `@gotgenes/pi-subagents-worktrees`, assessed 2026-07-10 at ~v0.x)

Friendly fork of `@tintinweb/pi-subagents` with worktree isolation extracted
into a pluggable `WorkspaceProvider`: each opted-in subagent runs in a
detached `git worktree` (`git worktree add --detach <tmpdir> HEAD`; unchanged
worktrees are removed, changed ones are committed to a `pi-agent-<id>` branch).
**A fourth execution model, mechanically the tintinweb one with a relabeled
cwd**: in-process `AgentSession` + `bindExtensions({})` per child — the same
SDK mechanics the tintinweb contracts (2a/2b/2c/2d) already pin, so **no new
Layer A contract and no Layer B addition is warranted**.

Findings that matter to pi-lens:

- **No `PI_SUBAGENT_CHILD` env marker is ever set** — this fork identifies its
  own children via a session-id-keyed `globalThis` registry
  (`Symbol.for("@gotgenes/pi-permission-system:subagent-registry")`), not env
  vars. `subagent-mode.ts`'s `isSubagentSession()` therefore never fires for
  it — **correctly**: the #473 concurrent-session guard classifies the child's
  `bindExtensions` `session_start` as `concurrent-secondary` and suppresses
  `handleSessionStart` entirely, so light mode has nothing to throttle. Do not
  "fix" light-mode detection to catch this case.
- The #473 classifier is cwd-agnostic by construction (ctx-liveness +
  session-id only), so the different-cwd child binds safely; the
  `concurrent_session_bind` phase already logs `sameCwd` for observability.
- **Known-acceptable gap, same class as pi-dynamic-workflows**: worktree
  children get zero pi-lens coverage (no diagnostics, read-guard, or LSP — the
  worktree is never a pi-lens project root because pi-lens never runs there).
  Edits surface to pi-lens only if/when the parent session touches the
  resulting branch/files.

### pi-delegate (`drsh4dow/pi-delegate`, Codeberg, assessed 2026-07-10)

Single-tool isolation extension: one fresh child agent per `delegate` call,
bounded task, distilled report back; explicitly not a workflow engine.
**Execution model = the pi-dynamic-workflows shape**: bare
`createAgentSession({...})` with a `DefaultResourceLoader` — it **never calls
`bindExtensions()`** (grep-verified in source + tests), so `session_start`
never fires in the child and pi-lens is a bystander there (no read-guard,
diagnostics, or dispatch on the child's edits). Nuance worth recording: the
loader's `additionalExtensionPaths` makes pi-lens's TOOLS discoverable in the
child's `getAllTools()` — discoverable-but-inert, since no lifecycle binding
ever happens. No #473 hazard, no #475 relevance, child disposed via
`dispose()` in a `finally`. **No contract pinned, no smoke coverage needed.**
Version-drift flag: imports the pre-rename `@mariozechner/*` SDK scope —
re-assess if this extension gets adopted against a current pi.

### avtc-pi-feature-flow / avtc-pi-subagent (assessed 2026-07-10 at avtc-pi-subagent@1.0.3)

Feature pipeline (design→plan→implement→verify→review→UAT) fanning out
child agents via its bundled `avtc-pi-subagent` engine: **real child-process
spawns of `pi --mode rpc` / `--mode json -p` — the nicobailon shape — but
with its OWN env vocabulary**: sets `PI_SUBAGENT_CHILD_AGENT` +
`PI_SUBAGENT_PARENT_PID`, **never `PI_SUBAGENT_CHILD=1`** (grep-verified).
`subagent-mode.ts` `isSubagentSession()` now detects this vocabulary too
(#507, fixed 2026-07-10): the pair `PI_SUBAGENT_CHILD_AGENT` +
`PI_SUBAGENT_PARENT_PID` (both non-empty) is treated as an additional
subagent signal, alongside nicobailon's `PI_SUBAGENT_CHILD=1`. The pair is
required rather than either var alone — a lone var set by some unrelated
tool must not trigger light mode by itself. `PI_LENS_SUBAGENT_FULL=1` remains
the universal opt-out for both vocabularies. `getSubagentIdentity()` now also
reports which vocabulary matched (`marker: "pi-subagents" | "avtc-pi-subagent"`),
surfaced in the `subagent_light_mode` latency phase so dogfooding can tell the
ecosystems apart. Its per-feature worktree isolation is the same bystander
situation as pi-dynamic-workflows' isolated worktrees — no separate row
needed for that.

Closed (#518, #507 itself was already CLOSED by PR #508): `avtc.child-env` is
now a Layer A pinned contract in `scripts/lib/compat-contracts.mjs`
(`checkAvtcChildEnv`, verified against `src/process-runner.ts`'s
`subagentEnv.PI_SUBAGENT_CHILD_AGENT = agent.name` +
`subagentEnv.PI_SUBAGENT_PARENT_PID = String(process.pid)` assignments), and
Layer B (`scripts/compat-smoke-behavioral.mjs`) gained two behavioral
assertions: the PAIR engages light mode, and a LONE `PI_SUBAGENT_CHILD_AGENT`
(without `PI_SUBAGENT_PARENT_PID`) correctly does NOT.

### pi-swarm (`gjczone/pi-swarm`, assessed 2026-07-11)

Agent-swarm orchestration ported from MoonshotAI/kimi-code: a `Swarm` tool
spawning 1–128 parallel subagents in isolated git worktrees, plus a
collaborative "Team" mode with a file-based JSONL mailbox (polling, no bus).
**Execution model = real out-of-process children — but with NO subagent
vocabulary at all**: `spawnSubagent` (`src/shared/spawner.ts:141-168`) builds
`pi --print <task>` CLI args and spawns via `child_process.spawn` with
`env: { ...process.env }` (`spawner.ts:397`) — a verbatim spread, zero
additions. No `PI_SUBAGENT_CHILD=1`, no `PI_SUBAGENT_CHILD_AGENT`/
`PI_SUBAGENT_PARENT_PID` pair, no `bindExtensions`/`createAgentSession`
in-process shape (grep-verified). Extensions DO activate in the children
(they are full `pi` processes), so pi-lens runs there — but
`classifySubagentSession()` sees no marker, light mode (#475) never engages,
and every child pays full startup cost (LSP pre-warm + heavyweight scans),
multiplied by up to 128 parallel worktrees. This is a **detection gap pi-lens
cannot close unilaterally**: there is nothing in the child environment to
key on. Fix is a one-line upstream change (adopt either existing vocabulary
at `spawner.ts:397`); upstream ask is approval-gated per house policy.
Active, well-maintained project (strict CI, last commit 2026-07-10). Its
subagent tool-blocklist (`pi-invoke.ts:29-35`, prevents recursive swarms) is
sound design, unrelated to pi-lens. **No contract to pin until upstream
adds markers.**
