/**
 * The CUE tool-smoke fixture has to PROVE a diagnostic fires (#1520 review F2).
 *
 * Two defects let it ship broken twice. First, the LSP lane's default verdict
 * is "handshook — server replied", which passes on ZERO diagnostics, so a
 * fixture whose entire purpose is to surface a defect passed while surfacing
 * nothing. Second, cuelsp only publishes the parse diagnostic when the package
 * clause is the very first line of the file; the fixture carried a comment
 * header above `package`, which suppressed the diagnostic outright.
 *
 * These guards bind both. They do not need a `cue` binary: the fixture shape is
 * a file fact, and the pass/fail decision is a pure function.
