/**
 * Warm turn-end IPC route (#538) — real end-to-end smoke: spawns the actual
 * server subprocess and drives its workspace socket directly with node:net,
 * which is the ONLY way to reach `startIpcServer`'s route handler (it is not
 * an MCP tool, so the stdio harness can't call it). The stub-server tests in
 * tests/clients/mcp/ipc.test.ts and tests/mcp/analyze-cli.test.ts pin both
 * CLIENT halves against a fake server; nothing else executes the server half —
 * the version gate, the `runTurnEnd` response assembly, or the untagged
 * analyze fallthrough the tagged branch was inserted in front of.
 *
 * The server is pointed at a throwaway cwd (not repoRoot) so it binds its OWN
 * `ipcPathForCwd` socket: every McpHarness in the parallel suite spawns with
 * `--cwd=repoRoot` and `startIpcServer` unlinks a stale socket before binding,
 * so sharing that path would let these tests and those fight over one endpoint.
 * `PILENS_DATA_DIR` keeps the real turn-end pass's cache/turn-state writes
 * inside the temp dir instead of the developer's `~/.pi-lens`.
 *
 * Requires `npm run build` first (resolves mcp/server.js next to its source).
