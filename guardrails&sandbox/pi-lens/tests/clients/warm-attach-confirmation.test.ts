/**
 * #1253 — the PRODUCER half of the warm-attach confirmation carriage.
 *
 * `WarmDiagnosticsResponse.confirmation` is the incumbent's own
 * `TouchFileResult.confirmation` re-surfaced as an explicit enumerable DTO
 * field. It exists because `inconclusive: false` is NOT the same evidence: a
 * `silentOnClean` server like marksman publishes nothing on a clean file, so
 * without the field an incumbent-served empty result is indistinguishable from
 * "never answered" on the far side and every clean Markdown file in a
 * warm-attached session renders unconfirmed.
 *
 * The consumer half is pinned in `tests/tools/lsp-diagnostics.test.ts` against a
 * mocked `tryWarmAttachedDiagnostics`, which means the field's ABSENCE degrades
 * correctly — but nothing pinned the incumbent actually emitting it. These tests
 * drive `serveRequest` directly (the socket wiring around it needs a bindable
 * unix socket, which is not available in every sandbox) and cover both
 * directions of the mixed-build contract:
 *
 *  - a confirmed touch emits `confirmation: "confirmed"`;
 *  - an unconfirmed touch OMITS the key entirely rather than serializing
 *    `undefined`, which is what makes an old client's `JSON.parse` see the same
 *    shape a pre-#1253 incumbent produces (safe-by-omission, no version bump).
