/**
 * Registered-or-fail sweep: every `pi.on(...)` registration in `index.ts`
 * either goes through the central stale-ctx wrapper, or names the reason it
 * does not (#1925).
 *
 * #1924 guarded `agent_settled` inline. #1925 found four siblings with the
 * same shape, because nothing forced the next handler author to think about
 * an invalidated ctx. Prose in a module doc cannot force it; this sweep can.
 * A NEW `pi.on` registration now reds until its author either wraps it or
 * writes down why the handler cannot be reached by a dead ctx.
 *
 * The scan is CALL-SHAPED (the #1692 lesson, via `tests/support/sweep-kit.ts`).
 * It strips comments, finds `on("<event>"` and `on?.("<event>"` calls, reads
 * their balanced argument text, and asks whether that text wraps the SAME
 * event name. A copy-pasted wrapper naming a different event would mislabel
 * the ledger subject, so it fails too.
 *
 * The declared floor of 12 is the second half of the emptiness guard. index.ts
 * registers 12 handlers today. A regex that stops matching one of them, the
 * way the first draft missed the `on?.()` form, drops the count and reds here
 * instead of quietly excusing the handler it can no longer see.
 *
 * #1929 moved `session_start` and `context` out of the exemption table and into
 * the wrapper, so seven registrations are wrapped and five carry a reason. The
 * registration count is unchanged: neither handler was added or removed.

Wrapping it would DROP a row whose `message` payload is still valid, so the handler records the attribution loss as a bounded `cache-usage-attribution-stale` ledger entry (subject `message_end`) when `probeCtxActive` confirms the stale ctx, while the row keeps writing.
