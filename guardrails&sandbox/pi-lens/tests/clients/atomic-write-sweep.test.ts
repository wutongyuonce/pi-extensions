/**
 * #1609 layer a: every persisted-state write under `clients/` must go
 * through the shared atomic tmp+rename seam (`clients/atomic-write.ts`, #762)
 * — directly, or via the locked `commitDurableStore`/`commitDurableStoreAsync`
 * read-modify-write built on it — OR be a reviewed, reasoned exemption.
 *
 * The write-site inventory is DERIVED from the source at test-run time
 * (`tests/support/atomic-write-scan.ts`'s `scanRawWriteFiles`), not
 * hand-maintained: this test would have caught the #1217 hand-rolled-staging
 * regression and the installer-binary direct-writes this issue's sweep found
 * (bare-gzip/bare-binary/jar/launcher/shim installs — see the PR body) without
 * anyone updating a parallel list first.
