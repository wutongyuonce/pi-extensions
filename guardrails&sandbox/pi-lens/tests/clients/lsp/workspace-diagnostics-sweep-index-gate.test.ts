/**
 * #645: a full-tree `lens_diagnostics mode=full` sweep fires a `didOpen` for
 * every file matching a `workspaceIndexing`-strategy server (marksman today —
 * see wait-policy/strategies.ts) in close succession. Before this fix, every one
 * of those touches independently paid that server's full `aggregateWaitMs`
 * (1500ms for marksman) racing the SAME one-time workspace-index build, so a
 * real project with 34 markdown files burned ~34 * 1500ms of structurally-
 * doomed wait in one sweep — not because marksman is slow per file, but
 * because the one-time index cost was charged once per file.
 *
 * `runWorkspaceDiagnostics` now creates one `SweepIndexGate` per sweep
 * (clients/lsp/index.ts) and threads it into every `touchFile` call via
 * `sweepIndexGate`. `touchFile`'s `perServerTimeout` consults the gate only
 * for a server whose strategy is marked `workspaceIndexing: true`: the FIRST
 * file touching that server in the sweep gets the full `aggregateWaitMs`
 * budget; every subsequent file in the SAME sweep gets the much shorter
 * `workspaceIndexingWarmWaitMs` instead. This test asserts that timing
 * behavior directly (the `ms` argument passed to `waitForDiagnostics`) and
 * separately confirms a genuine timeout on a warm-wait touch still reports
 * `timedOut: true` — the #634 unconfirmed/inconclusive contract must not
 * regress into a false-clean read just because the wait got shorter.
