/**
 * #1723 residual: the workspace-diagnostics sweep's per-file touch is
 * bracketed, so a block that fires DURING it has a name.
 *
 * PR #1805 wired in-flight phase attribution at the dispatcher's `runRunner`
 * chokepoint and named this second site as a deferred gap. It is not a
 * hypothetical one: the 18 270 ms block in #1723's own reproduction carries
 * `lastPhase: lsp_workspace_diagnostics`, i.e. the sweep's own COMPLETION
 * record. `lastPhase` names a phase that already finished, so the sweep could
 * only ever appear in a loop_block record AFTER it stopped being the culprit.
 *
 * `getPhaseForWindow` (clients/latency-logger.ts) reads live and
 * recently-closed brackets. Without a bracket around `processFile`, a block
 * inside the sweep overlaps nothing and the record is anonymous.
 *
 * These drive the REAL `runWorkspaceDiagnostics` and observe the bracket from
 * inside the touch — the instant a synchronous block would fire — rather than
 * calling `phaseStarted` directly, which would pin nothing about the wiring.

		 * #2272 review F1 — the headline case, and the one the four above could

		 * All of them read attribution from INSIDE the touch, on a one or two

		 * in index.ts calls `getPhaseForWindow` AFTER the sweep has finished,
		 * and a real sweep is hundreds of files.
		 *
		 * That gap hid a defect that made the whole feature inert for its own
		 * motivating case. With one bracket PER FILE, a 225-file sweep pushes
		 * 225 entries through a closed-bracket ring capped at
		 * CLOSED_BRACKET_CAP = 5 (latency-logger.ts). The bracket belonging to
		 * the file that actually blocked is evicted unless the block lands in
		 * the last five files — roughly 2% of a sweep. The five survivors are
		 * then rejected by MIN_PLAUSIBLE_ELAPSED_FRACTION, because a fast
		 * trailing file's bracket is far shorter than the block window. Net
		 * result: silence, which is exactly what #1723 opened about.
		 *
		 * One bracket around the whole per-file loop fixes it and is also the
		 * simpler shape. The phase string is a constant carrying no per-file
		 * identity, so 225 brackets never held more information than one; they
		 * only cost 225 map inserts and destroyed the ring.
