/**
 * #1459 — a cascade sweep must not drive a scanner into the notify-write
 * breaker, and a scanner's silence must never read as a clean verdict.
 *
 * Before this fix a `clientScope: "all"` sweep fanned a full-text `didOpen`
 * resync at opengrep for every neighbour inside a few milliseconds. Its stdin
 * stopped draining, three per-server write deadlines expired, and the #743
 * breaker opened for 15 s. Every touch inside that window then skipped the
 * scanner and still resolved `confirmation: "confirmed"` — a security blackout
 * that read as scanned-clean.
 *
 * These tests verify:
 *  1. A burst of concurrent resyncs at an auxiliary issues ONE write (the rest
 *     defer), so the breaker never trips, and the deferred touches report the
 *     scanner as uncovered.
 *  2. A write that lands after its deadline retracts the timeout it was charged
 *     for — slow is not broken.
 *  3. A write nothing accepts for the whole wedge window still demotes the
 *     server, so the gate cannot defer a dead input path forever.
 *  4. A touch that skipped a scanner because its breaker was open resolves
 *     `"partial"` and names the scanner, not `"confirmed"`.

 * #1586 — the deferred door judged coverage from the PRE-NOTIFY snapshot.

 * #1571 established the merge-time predicate (`auxCoversThisContent`): a stored
 * binding read at MERGE time, unioned with #1493's pre-notify snapshot, deciding
 * both whether an auxiliary's findings are dropped and whether it is named
 * uncovered. The deferred door never went through it — it filtered
 * `notifyDeferredServerIds` on the snapshot alone and dropped every deferred
 * server's findings unconditionally. The snapshot is taken BEFORE the notify, so
 * it cannot see the publication that #1459's own late-write signature produces:
 * the outstanding write the gate deferred behind LANDS, the scanner scans, and it
 * publishes for exactly these bytes while the deferred touch is still waiting.
 *
 * The fixture is that race, with two CONCURRENT touches of one file sharing one
 * scanner client:
 *   - the FIRST claims the scanner's single resync slot with a slow write;
 *   - the SECOND is DEFERRED behind it, and its pre-notify snapshot sees nothing;
 *   - the first write then lands and the scanner publishes;
 *   - the primary publishes later still, so the deferred touch is demonstrably
 *     mid-wait when that happens.
