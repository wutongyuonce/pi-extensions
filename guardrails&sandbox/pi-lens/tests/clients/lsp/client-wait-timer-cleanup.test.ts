/**
 * Regression test for #1097 — `pi --print --no-session` never exits after
 * `agent_settled`.
 *
 * Root cause: `LSPService.getClientForFile` raced the client-wait against an
 * inline `setTimeout(effectiveMaxWaitMs)` whose handle was never stored, so when
 * the client resolved first (the common case) the losing timer stayed a REF'D
 * pending timer for the full remaining wait budget. In a long-lived interactive
 * session that is invisible; in a one-shot print process it keeps the event loop
 * alive for up to `effectiveMaxWaitMs` after the run settles, so the completed
 * process hangs instead of exiting (a recurrence of #22's symptom via a
 * different handle).
 *
 * The fix clears the timer once the race settles. This test proves it by racing
 * a fast client win against a large wait budget and asserting no pending timer
 * survives — it FAILS on the pre-fix code (the orphaned wait timer lingers) and
 * PASSES once the timer is cleared.
