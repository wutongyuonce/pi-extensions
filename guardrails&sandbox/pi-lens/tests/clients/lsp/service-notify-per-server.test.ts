/**
 * #743 — per-server notify-write deadlines.
 *
 * Before this fix the didOpen/didChange write for a `clientScope:"all"` touch
 * fanned out across every spawned server under a SINGLE `notifyWriteBudgetMs`
 * deadline (`Promise.all`). One backpressured server (stalled stdin) timed out
 * the write for the ENTIRE file, flipping the touch to inconclusive and zeroing
 * every co-touched healthy server's diagnostics — none reached `demonstratedReady`.
 *
 * These tests verify:
 *  1. One server timing out its write does NOT mark the others timed out, and a
 *     healthy sibling still becomes `demonstratedReady`.
 *  2. Repeated write timeouts (>= NOTIFY_BACKPRESSURE_BROKEN_AFTER = 3) trip the
 *     existing `broken` cooldown for that server and evict its client.
 *  3. A single successful write resets the consecutive-timeout streak.
