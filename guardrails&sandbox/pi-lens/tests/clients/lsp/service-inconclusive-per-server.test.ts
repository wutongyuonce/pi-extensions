/**
 * #1549 — the touch verdict is PER SERVER, aggregated honestly.
 *
 * The rule this replaced was `inconclusive = notifyWriteTimedOut ||
 * diagnosticsTimedOut` with both flags TOUCH-WIDE over every spawned server. A
 * cascade neighbour sweep attaches ~5 servers per touch, `timeoutMs` is the MAX
 * over the servers waited on, and opengrep declares 3500ms — so one slow-but-
 * healthy scanner made the whole touch report "nothing is known about this file"
 * even when typescript answered in 100ms. Measured over 6,079 neighbour sweeps:
 * 97.6% inconclusive, against 15% for ordinary edit-time touches in the same
 * window; a post-#1528 dogfood still showed 37/37 inconclusive with the flood
 * fixed, which is what confirmed the merge rule as the driver.
 *
 * What must hold now:
 *   1. An answered primary beside a slow auxiliary is NOT inconclusive — its
 *      findings are usable — and the auxiliary is named as a coverage gap
 *      (`confirmation: "partial"` + `unconfirmedServerIds`, the #1493/#1533
 *      machinery), so nothing reads it as a clean bill of health.
 *   2. A primary that produced no evidence still makes the touch inconclusive
 *      (the fix may only ever NARROW a verdict, never invent a confirmation).
 *   3. An auxiliary's notify-write failure is a coverage gap too, not a verdict.
 *   4. A primary's notify-write failure IS a verdict, attributed as such.
 *   5. `inconclusiveServerIds`/`inconclusiveReason` name who and why, on the
 *      result and in `lsp_touch_file`/`lsp_diagnostics_timeout` — the issue's
 *      observability contract, so the next forensic sweep reads the cause
 *      instead of inferring it from duration histograms.

/**
 * A faithful client double. Three production behaviours matter to every probe in
 * this file, and a double that skips any of them makes the probe vacuous
 * (defect shape 7):
 *
 *  1. `notify.open` CLEARS this path's diagnostics cache entry
 *     (`clearDiagnosticsForPath`) when the write lands. A present entry after a
 *     touch is therefore a fresh answer, which is the second evidence signal the
 *     verdict reads — and the signal the #814 aggregate gate reads through
 *     `getAllDiagnostics`, a REQUIRED method on `LSPClient`. Omitting it makes
 *     that gate throw into its own catch, so a fail-safe would pass by accident.
 *  2. A publication advances the PER-PATH stamp (#1531) and records a content
 *     BINDING for the exact bytes it was computed from (#1095/#1493) — only when
 *     the server actually publishes: findings, or an empty result under
 *     `publishesWhenClean`.
 *  3. A write can be SLOW without being lost. `notifyDelayMs` models the
 *     late-landing write that #1459 documents: charged as timed out against the
 *     caller's budget, it still lands, and the scanner then publishes for these
 *     bytes. `hangingNotify` is the other shape — a write that never lands at all.
