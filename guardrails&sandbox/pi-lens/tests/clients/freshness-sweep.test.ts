/**
 * Registered-or-fail sweep for the freshness kernel (#1739).
 *
 * Every mtime-vs-reference-timestamp comparison in `clients/` must go
 * through the kernel's comparator. A NEW out-of-kernel comparison fails
 * here until it is either migrated or added to EXEMPT with a reason - the
 * same ratchet shape as run-outcome-ratchet and the smoke-fixture guard.
 *
 * The needle matches the freshness SHAPE (`.mtimeMs` compared with > or >=
 * against an identifier expression), not just the words: age-based checks
 * (`Date.now() - mtime > TTL`) and max-selection comparisons
 * (`mtime > best.mtimeMs`) are structurally different and listed as
 * exemptions with reasons where they coexist in a file.
 *
 * KNOWN MISSED SHAPES (accepted floor - the needle cannot see them):
 * destructured comparisons without a dot (for (const { mtimeMs } of mtimes)
 * if (mtimeMs > ref) - exactly master's detectDrift import-loop shape),
 * reversed operand order (ref + TOL < x.mtimeMs), and aliased locals.
