/**
 * Coverage gate for the shared availability policy (#1476).
 *
 * #1467 fixed four clients that each latched a timed-out probe as a permanent
 * "tool is not installed" verdict. Its class sweep still missed three more, and
 * the #1476 sweep found three beyond those — including `ctx.hasTool`, the
 * generic seam every CLI runner gates on. The next tool would have been the
 * eleventh. This test DERIVES the consumer list from the source tree and fails
 * when a consumer it can SEE decides availability with its own copy of the rule.
 *
 * It is not a proof that no such consumer exists, and it must not be cited as
 * one. A verification round invented twelve shapes it does not catch — accessor
 * pairs, WeakMap and symbol-keyed stores, cross-module probe helpers, spawn
 * behind a constructor-assigned indirection, string-union verdicts — and three
 * of those are already idiomatic in this repo. Five sites it could not see are
 * now migrated — `createCwdCachedProbe` with its eslint, credo and rust-clippy
 * consumers (#1494), `formatters.ts` (#1495), `package-manager.ts` (#1496) —
 * and the last two are STILL invisible to it, which is the clearest statement of
 * the limit: they probe with `which <command>`, so there is no version flag for
 * the pre-filter to find. A fix the gate cannot see is also a regression the gate
 * cannot catch, and that residual is tracked in #1499.
 *
 * The first version of this gate was regexes and a review broke it seven ways in
 * one sitting. Treating a gate as proof is how that happened; every widening
 * below is pinned by a fixture so the next narrowing is visible.
 *
 * ## Structural, and per unit
 *
 * The analysis lives in `tests/support/availability-gate.ts` and runs on the
 * real AST (`@ast-grep/napi`), not on file text. Two properties come from that
 * and both were bought with review findings:
 *
 *   * "routed through the policy" means an `import_statement` node binds a
 *     policy symbol. A `// route this through availability-policy.js` comment
 *     used to clear a file. It no longer parses as anything at all.
 *   * the unit of judgement is a top-level declaration, not a file. The
 *     file-level gate cleared `runner-helpers.ts` and `govulncheck-client.ts`
 *     because each already imported the policy for a DIFFERENT memo, hiding two
 *     of the seven sites this change migrates.
 *
 * A unit is a consumer when it spawns a version probe AND parks the verdict in
 * state that outlives the call. It must then reach the shared policy: directly,
 * via `createAvailabilityChecker`, or by extending `SecurityScanClient`.
 *
 * ## The known-gap baseline
 *
 * `KNOWN_GAPS` is a shrink-only list of latches that predate this gate and are
 * tracked separately. It is not the hand-maintained roster #883 warned about:
 * nothing is added to it silently — a NEW unrouted consumer fails the gate, and
 * a baseline entry that stops being flagged ALSO fails, so a fix cannot leave
 * dead scaffolding behind.
