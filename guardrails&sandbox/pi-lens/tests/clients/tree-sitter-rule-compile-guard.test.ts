/**
 * Compile-guard for every shipped tree-sitter rule (#884).
 *
 * A rule whose query fails to compile against its grammar is silently dead:
 * `compileQueryBatch` drops it from the batch and `compileRawQuery` returns
 * null, so `runQueryOnFile`/`runQueriesOnFile` report zero matches forever —
 * indistinguishable from "this rule found nothing". #884 found 32 enabled
 * rules in exactly this state. This test compiles every non-disabled rule
 * against its language's real grammar so a newly-broken query fails CI
 * instead of silently returning nothing forever.
 *
 * It sweeps the rule set each language is actually DISPATCHED (
 * `queriesForLanguage`), not the raw loader map, so a rule is also compiled
 * against every grammar that inherits it — the typescript set is handed to tsx,
 * and a rule that compiles against typescript but not tsx is dead on every
 * `.tsx` file with nothing else to notice.
 *
 * KNOWN_BROKEN is the exact list of rules broken at the time #884 was filed
 * (recorded by running this same compile sweep). It exists ONLY so this test
 * can ship before the (in-progress, parallel) rule fixes land — every entry
 * is a rule this test currently expects to FAIL, not an accepted exception.
 * The contract for those follow-up PRs: fix the rule's query, then remove its
 * id from KNOWN_BROKEN in this file. If you don't remove it, the "still
 * broken" assertion below fails once the query starts compiling — the list
 * can only shrink, never grow silently.
