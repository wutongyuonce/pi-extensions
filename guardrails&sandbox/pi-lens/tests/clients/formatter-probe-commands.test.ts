/**
 * #1495 review — pin which binaries each formatter's `detect()` actually probes.
 *
 * #1539 removed the `command[0]` approximation this test was written to make
 * visible: the poison guard now reads the binaries a `detect()` really consulted
 * out of an `AsyncLocalStorage` probe record, so an unaccounted extra probe is
 * no longer invisible to it. The pin stays, for the fact it was always really
 * pinning: WHICH binaries a detection reaches for. That is a policy decision —
 * an install fallback probed eagerly, or a formatter quietly gaining a second
 * interpreter — and it should not change without someone saying so here.
 *
 * The allowance is asserted in BOTH directions (#1532 review). One-directional
 * was mutation-proven wrong: a bogus entry for zig passed, and a real one had
 * gone stale — `oxfmt: ["vp"]` was an orphan, because oxfmt's `which("vp")` and
 * `which("oxfmt")` live in `resolveCommand`, not `detect()`, whose whole body is
 * config-file checks. An unused allowance silently widens the pin.
