/**
 * Reset-interleaving explorer (#1840).
 *
 * The session-straddling class (catalog shapes 1/9 in AGENTS.md) is the
 * repo's most recurrent defect shape: an async path holds intermediate state
 * across an `await`, a `handleSessionStart` reset fires while it is
 * suspended, and the path resumes as if nothing happened — a write lands in
 * the wrong session, a budget re-arms mid-run, a latch survives past its
 * owning session. #1746 R2-F1, #1801 F1, #1785, #1805 F4, and #1807's capture
 * lifecycle are five instances of this ONE shape in one review window, and
 * every one shipped before review caught it: a reviewer picked ONE await
 * point by hand and fired the reset there. This module makes that systematic
 * — every await point, not the one a reviewer happened to guess.
 *
 * ## Mechanism: explicit yield taps, not a tick-counting scheduler
 *
 * Two mechanisms were prototyped before choosing this one.
 *
 * (a) A wrapping scheduler that counts microtask ticks and fires the reset at
 * the Nth tick, with no code changes to the path under test. This was
 * spiked against `runManagedToolRefresh` by patching `global.Promise` to
 * count `.then` continuations reached during one run. The tick count was NOT
 * stable across two runs of the identical code path with identical mocked
 * inputs: `fs/promises`, the mocked `safeSpawnAsync`, and `JSON.parse`
 * chains inside the installer each contribute their own internal
 * `.then` hops, and the count of those hops depends on V8 internals (how
 * many microtask turns a given native promise resolution takes), not on the
 * number of `await` keywords in the source. Two identical runs produced tick
 * counts that differed by 1-2 depending on unrelated GC/scheduling noise in
 * spike runs. A mechanism whose address space ("the Nth tick") is not
 * reproducible cannot honor "run once per await point" — it cannot even
 * promise the SAME point twice, let alone every point once. Rejected.
 *
 * (b) Explicit yield taps: the path under test accepts an optional `tap`
 * callback and `await`s it at each point a reset could plausibly land. This
 * needs a one-line seam in the path under test (`await tap()`), but the
 * address space is then exactly what the caller wrote — deterministic,
 * reviewable, and immune to unrelated internal `.then` hops. Chosen.
 *
 * ## Cost
 *
 * N tap points cost N+1 full executions of `run` (one baseline pass to count
 * the tap points, one per tap point to fire the reset there). `maxTapPoints`
 * (default 50) caps this — a path exposing more than that is refused rather
 * than silently spending minutes per test run; raise the cap deliberately if
 * a real path needs more.
 *
 * ## Usage
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { exploreInterleavings } from "../../support/reset-explorer.js";
 *
 * await exploreInterleavings({
 *   run: (tap) => runManagedToolRefreshForExploration(NOW, tap),
 *   reset: () => resetManagedToolRefreshSession(),
 *   invariant: ({ tapIndex, result }) => {
 *     // Runs after the baseline pass (tapIndex === null) AND after every
 *     // reset-at-tap-N pass. Throw/expect() to fail.
 *     expect(updateCalls().length).toBeLessThanOrEqual(1);
 *   },
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * The path under test owns what counts as a tap point — this module has no
 * opinion on which `await`s matter, only that whatever set the caller wired
 * up gets visited exactly once each, deterministically.
