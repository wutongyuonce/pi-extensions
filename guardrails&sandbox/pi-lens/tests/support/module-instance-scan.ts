/**
 * Mechanical scan for the ".ts specifier reaches a duplicate module instance"
 * hazard (#1565).
 *
 * The repo's runtime IS the compiled output: `npm run build` emits a sibling
 * `.js` beside every source `.ts` outside `tests/`, and production code imports
 * those `.js` specifiers. Vite/Vitest resolve an import specifier LITERALLY —
 * `x.js` loads the compiled file whenever it is on disk, and only falls back to
 * `x.ts` when it is not. So a test that spells a module `x.ts` gets a SECOND
 * instance of that module: its own module-level state (generation counters,
 * latches, memo maps) is a copy, while everything it imports (`./dep.js`) is
 * still shared with the compiled graph.
 *
 * The consequence is a vacuous test (defect shape 7): a `beforeEach` that calls
 * a reset imported through `.ts` bumps the copy's counter and leaves the
 * compiled state the code under test actually reads untouched. The assertion
 * then passes without ever observing the behaviour it claims to guard.
 *
 * The check is deliberately STATIC — it flags the `.ts` specifier itself rather
 * than looking for a `.js` twin on disk. A freshness- or twin-based check goes
 * silent in an unbuilt tree (no `.js` files exist yet, so every specifier
 * collapses onto the source and nothing looks mixed), which is exactly the
 * state a contributor's first run is in.
