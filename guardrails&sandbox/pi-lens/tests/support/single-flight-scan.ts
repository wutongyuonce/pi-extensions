/**
 * Ratchet scan for hand-rolled at-most-one-in-flight state — #1753.
 *
 * `clients/single-flight.ts` owns the four guards that the ten hand-rolled
 * copies kept getting wrong (#1690, #1674, #1687, #1722). A primitive nobody
 * reaches for is a primitive that decays, so this scan makes the NEXT copy
 * argue for itself: any new module-level or class-field declaration whose name
 * contains `inFlight` fails until it is either built on the primitive or listed
 * with a reason.
 *
 * It is a ratchet, not a migration. Everything the scan finds today is listed;
 * the list is the burn-down backlog, and each entry says why it is still there.

 * Declarations this scan can see, and the three it cannot.
 *
 * IN, three forms:
 *
 * 1. module-level `const`/`let`/`var` at column 0;
 * 2. class fields carrying an accessibility, `readonly`, `static` or `abstract`
 *    modifier, at any indent;
 * 3. modifier-less class fields — both `#private` ones, which the `#` makes
 *    unambiguous, and plain ones carrying a TYPE ANNOTATION. Review round 1
 *    caught this gap: `probeInFlight: Promise<void> | null = null;` is the
 *    migrated sites' exact field minus the word `private`, and the first
 *    version of this regex sailed straight past it.
 *
 * OUT, stated rather than papered over:
 *
 * 1. state closed over inside a factory function (`createChecker`'s
 *    `inFlightByCwd` in `runner-helpers.ts`) — indistinguishable from a plain
 *    function local by shape alone, and flagging every local named `inFlight`
 *    would make the ratchet noise rather than signal;
 * 2. in-flight state whose name does not contain `inFlight`
 *    (`refreshRepullRunning` in `lsp/client.ts` is exactly that, which is part
 *    of why #1687 went unnoticed);
 * 3. a modifier-less, UNANNOTATED class field (`inFlight = new Map();` with no
 *    `private` and no type). By shape that is identical to a bare assignment to
 *    a closure variable — `ensureInFlight = null;` at
 *    `dispatch/runners/utils/toolchain-availability.ts:139` is exactly that —
 *    and this scan chooses the false negative over flagging every
 *    clear-in-finally in the repo.
 *
 * All three are FALSE NEGATIVES. The ratchet still catches the common case,
 * which is the copy someone writes by pattern-matching a sibling client.
 *
 * FALSE POSITIVES are the safe direction, which is why they are not enumerated:
 * they announce themselves. The widened regex also matches things that are not
 * declarations at all — object-literal properties and parameter annotations —
 * so `lsp/index.ts`'s `inFlight` matches both at its interface member (:204)
 * and at its object-literal initializer (:1198). Both collapse to one
 * `file:symbol` key, and any such match simply demands an exemption that a
 * person then writes or dismisses. A false negative is silent and ships the
 * next copy of the bug; a false positive costs one line and a moment's thought.
