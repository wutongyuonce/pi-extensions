/**
 * Topology-derived cache consumer scan — #2294.
 *
 * `registerWorkspaceTopologyReset` (`clients/workspace-topology.ts`) is a
 * PUSH-ONLY registry: a module that memoizes results derived from topology
 * probe seams registers a downstream reset only by calling it. There is no
 * pull-side authority that notices a NEW consumer forgot to register. Three
 * modules wire this today (`startup-scan.ts`, `review-graph/tsconfig-paths.ts`,
 * `language-profile.ts`); the registry cannot tell whether that list is
 * complete.
 *
 * This scan is the compensating, pull-side guard. It ENUMERATES the modules
 * under `clients/` that structurally IMPORT a topology probe seam from its
 * canonical source path, then the conformance
 * test asserts each is either registered (the file calls
 * `registerWorkspaceTopologyReset(`) or carries a documented freshness-key
 * exemption. A future consumer that memoizes from a seam without registering
 * shows up as an unaccounted item, exactly like a session-state file that
 * forgets `handleSessionStart`.
 *
 * ## Population rule: IMPORT-aware binding detection
 *
 * The population is scoped to the CANONICAL SOURCE MODULES that export the
 * governed probe seams — `workspace-topology.js` for its probe exports and
 * `startup-scan.js` for `findNearestProjectRoot` — and detected by IMPORT
 * binding, not by call shape. A module is a consumer when a governed probe
 * enters its scope through any of:
 *
 * - a named import: `import { getDirectoryMarkers } from "..."`;
 * - an ALIASED named import: `import { getDirectoryMarkers as markers }` —
 *   the imported name is still the governed probe, so this belongs to the
 *   population even though the call site spells `markers(...)` (the defect a
 *   call-shaped sweep misses);
 * - a NAMESPACE import of a canonical module:
 *   `import * as topo from "workspace-topology.js"` — the namespace makes
 *   every governed probe of that module reachable as `topo.<probe>`.
 *
 * A named import of a governed probe enters the population even when the local
 * binding is never called — importing the seam is the act that can feed a
 * memo. Stateless imports that hold no derived cache are documented
 * exemptions, exactly like the call-shaped population's per-run consumers.
 *
 * Crucially, an UNRELATED same-name LOCAL function or module does NOT enter
 * the population: `function getDirectoryMarkers() {}` in a file that never
 * imports the seam is not a topology consumer, and a call-shaped detector
 * would flag it. Import-scoped binding detection is what keeps that out.
 *
 * Multiline named imports and namespace imports are supported; both a default
 * and a named binding in one statement are handled. Type-only and
 * side-effect-only imports of a canonical module carry no runtime probe
 * binding and do not enter the population.
 *
 * ## The probe-seam list (the canonical set)
 *
 * The seams that READ the shared marker/walk index and could feed a derived
 * memo. Lifecycle helpers (`resetWorkspaceTopology`,
 * `registerWorkspaceTopologyReset`, `releaseWorkspaceTopologyIdleTimers`) are
 * deliberately excluded — they are the reset/teardown mechanism, not a read
 * whose result a consumer memoizes.
