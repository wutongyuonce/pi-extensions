 * A shared builder for the dispatch-runner `DispatchContext` (#187 — Tier 2
 * follow-up to #171).
 *
 * #171 consolidated the three parallel `ExtensionAPI` mocks onto
 * `createPiMock`/`makeCtx` (`./pi-mock.ts`). Dispatch-runner tests are a
 * separate, unrelated context shape (`clients/dispatch/types.ts`'s
 * `DispatchContext`) that ~26 files under `tests/clients/dispatch/runners/*`
 * each hand-rolled locally as `function createCtx(filePath, cwd) { ... }`.
 * `makeRunnerCtx()` is the single source of truth for that shape so runner
 * tests stop drifting from the real interface and from each other.
 *
 * Typed against the real `DispatchContext` (`clients/dispatch/types.ts`), not
 * a guessed shape — any field the interface adds/removes shows up here as a
 * type error instead of silently going stale in 26 copies.
