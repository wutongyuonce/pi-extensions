/**
 * Shared fault-injection primitives for tests (#1838).
 *
 * The highest-value findings of the 2026-08 window came from bespoke fault
 * probes reviewers built by hand, each once: a genuinely wedged child pipe
 * (#1811), a snapshot save racing inside a stall window (#1807), a budget
 * starved by CPU scheduling (#1785), a session reset fired from inside a
 * mocked spawn (#1746 R2-F1). Every one of those is the same primitive with a
 * different costume. This module is where they live from now on, so catalog
 * shapes 1/3/9 (latch re-arm, teardown liveness, session-straddling writes)
 * are cheap to probe in every fixer's red-first pass instead of
 * reviewer-only heroics.
 *
 * Composition: `suspendAt` (`tests/clients/interleaving-kit.ts`) parks a seam
 * INDEFINITELY until released; `delayInside` resolves it after a bounded
 * delay; `fireResetAt` lets it side-effect mid-flight. `gatedPromise` is the
 * building block all three are built from when a test needs direct control.
 *
 * Every primitive here carries its own fidelity test next door
 * (fault-injection.test.ts) — the #1673 lesson: an inert double is worse than
 * none, and a kit that quietly degrades into one must go red in CI, not in
 * review.
