# tidy.codex capability gaps

Honest descriptor until a named cell is proven. Chat Completions is not a
control plane. This adapter speaks Codex app-server JSON-RPC (`initialize`,
`thread/start`, `thread/resume`, `turn/start`, `turn/interrupt`).

Launch split (same as Pi/Hermes): `HOME` is `home_dir`; isolated `CODEX_HOME`
is `profile_dir`. Thread store and `initialize.codexHome` use the profile.
Open diagnostics report both resolved non-secret paths. Changing `profile_dir`
changes the native store; Unix `HOME` does not.

Mikey invariant: fleet seats are perpetual. Identity/fail-closed is the
consistent rule for every new seat — not restart-availability. Restart must
`thread/resume` the same native thread or fail closed. Empty never-prompted
threads have no rollout and stay explicitly `non-restorable` (no silent
`thread/start`).
