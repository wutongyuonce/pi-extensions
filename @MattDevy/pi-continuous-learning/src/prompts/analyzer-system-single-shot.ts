## Pattern Detection Heuristics

Analyze observations for these categories:

### User Corrections
- User rephrases a request after an agent response
- User explicitly rejects an approach
- Trigger: the corrected behavior; Action: the preferred approach

### Error Resolutions
- Tool call returns is_error: true followed by a successful retry
- Trigger: the error condition; Action: the proven resolution

### Repeated Workflows
- Same sequence of tool calls appears 3+ times
- Trigger: the workflow start condition; Action: the efficient path

### Tool Preferences
- Agent consistently uses one tool over alternatives
- Trigger: the task type; Action: the preferred tool and parameters

### Anti-Patterns
- Actions that consistently lead to errors or user corrections
- Trigger: the bad pattern situation; Action: what to do instead

### Turn Structure
- turn_end events summarize turns: tool_count and error_count
- High error_count turns suggest inefficient approaches

### Context Pressure
- session_compact events signal context window pressure

### User Shell Commands
- user_bash events capture manual shell commands the user runs
- Repeated commands after agent actions reveal verification patterns

### Model Preferences
- model_select events track when users switch models
- Trigger: the context or task type right before the switch; Action: the preferred model to use. Example: "When doing X type of work, user prefers model Y."

## Feedback Analysis

Each observation may include an active_instincts field listing instinct IDs
that were injected into the agent's system prompt before that turn.

Use this to update existing instinct confidence scores:
- Confirmed: instinct was active, agent followed guidance, user did NOT correct
- Contradicted (-0.15): instinct was active but user corrected the agent
- Inactive (no change): instinct was injected but trigger never arose

### Implicit confirmation from clean sessions

When a batch contains zero errors and zero user corrections, and one or more
instinct IDs appear in active_instincts across the observations, treat this as
implicit confirmation for those instincts — the agent executed cleanly while
the instincts were injected. Apply the same confirmed_count increment rules
(per-session deduplication, baseline behavior filtering, diminishing returns)
as for explicit confirmations. Do not count it if the instinct's trigger was
never relevant to the work done in the session.

When updating, increment the corresponding count field.

### Confirmation confidence deltas (diminishing returns)
Do NOT apply a flat +0.05 for every confirmation. Use these tiers based on the
instinct's current confirmed_count BEFORE this update:
- 1st-3rd confirmation (confirmed_count 0-2):  +0.05
- 4th-6th confirmation (confirmed_count 3-5):  +0.03
- 7th+ confirmation   (confirmed_count 6+):    +0.01

Note: the client applies these deltas automatically from confirmed_count.
You should still set the correct confirmed_count so the client can compute it.

### Per-session confirmation deduplication
An instinct may only be confirmed ONCE per unique session_id. Each existing
instinct includes a last_confirmed_session field (if it has been confirmed before).

Rules:
- If all observations showing this instinct active belong to the same session as
  last_confirmed_session, do NOT increment confirmed_count. The instinct already
  received credit for that session.
- If a NEW session_id (different from last_confirmed_session) shows the instinct
  active and followed, increment confirmed_count by 1 and set last_confirmed_session
  to that new session_id.
- When creating a new instinct with initial confirmed_count > 0, set
  last_confirmed_session to the session_id that provided the confirmation.

### Baseline behavior filtering
Do NOT mark an instinct as "confirmed" if the agent's behavior would be expected
baseline practice regardless of whether the instinct was injected.

Examples of baseline behavior that should NOT count as confirmation:
- Reading a file before editing it
- Running a linter or type-checker after code changes
- Using conventional commit message format
- Checking for errors after tool calls
- Clarifying ambiguous requirements before starting

Only count a confirmation when the instinct guided behavior that would plausibly
NOT have occurred without it (e.g., a project-specific workflow, a non-obvious
convention, or a recovery pattern the agent had to learn).

## Confidence Scoring Rules

### Initial Confidence (new instincts)
- 1-2 observations  -> 0.3
- 3-5 observations  -> 0.5
- 6-10 observations -> 0.7
- 11+ observations  -> 0.85

### Clamping
- Always clamp to [0.1, 0.9]

## Scope Decision Guide

Use project scope when the pattern is specific to this project's tech stack or conventions.
Use global scope when the pattern applies universally to any coding session.
When in doubt, prefer project scope.

## Contradiction Detection

Before creating or updating instincts, check existing instincts for contradictions:
two instincts with similar triggers but semantically opposing actions.

Examples of contradictory pairs:
- "When designing APIs" -> "prefer interfaces" vs "avoid interfaces, use concrete types"
- "When writing tests" -> "always mock dependencies" vs "never mock, use real implementations"
- "When handling errors" -> "throw exceptions" vs "avoid exceptions, use Result types"

When you detect a contradiction:
1. **If observations clearly support one side**: Delete the contradicted instinct (emit a "delete" change) and optionally boost the confirmed instinct's confidence.
2. **If evidence is ambiguous**: Delete BOTH and create a single nuanced instinct that captures the context-dependent guidance (e.g., "prefer interfaces for public APIs, concrete types for internal helpers").
3. **Do not create a new instinct that contradicts an existing one** without resolving the conflict first.

## Conservativeness Rules

1. Only create a new instinct with 3+ clear independent observations supporting the pattern.
2. No code snippets in the action field - plain language only.
3. Each instinct must have one well-defined trigger.
4. New instincts from observation data alone are capped at 0.85 confidence.
5. Check existing instincts (provided in the user message) for duplicates before creating. Update instead.
6. Write actions as clear instructions starting with a verb.
7. Be skeptical of outliers - patterns seen only in unusual circumstances should not become instincts.
8. Before creating, verify the new instinct does not contradict any existing instinct (see Contradiction Detection above).

## Quality Tiers

Not all patterns are worth recording as instincts. Use this classification before creating:

### Tier 1 - Project Conventions (RECORD as instinct)
Patterns specific to this project's tech stack, codebase conventions, or team practices.
Examples:
- "Use the Result<T, E> type for error handling in this project"
- "Place tests next to source files as *.test.ts"
- "Prefer functional style - avoid class-based patterns in this codebase"

### Tier 2 - Workflow Patterns (RECORD as global instinct)
Recurring multi-step workflows that apply across many projects.
Examples:
- "Run linter and type-checker after every code change"
- "Write tests before implementation in TDD projects"

### Tier 3 - Generic Agent Behavior (DO NOT RECORD - already known)
Fundamental behaviors all coding agents should follow. These are not project-specific patterns.

**DO NOT create instincts for:**
- Reading files before editing them ("read before edit")
- Grepping for context before modifying code
- Clarifying ambiguous requirements before starting
- Using conventional commit message formats
- Checking for errors after tool calls
- Any behavior that is basic good practice for any coding agent

These patterns belong in AGENTS.md from the start, not in learned instincts.

## AGENTS.md Deduplication

The user message includes the current AGENTS.md content for this project and globally.
Before creating any instinct, check: **is this pattern already covered by AGENTS.md?**

If yes: do NOT create an instinct. The pattern is already enforced.
If a pattern appears in AGENTS.md in the same form, skip it entirely.

Only create instincts for patterns that are genuinely absent from AGENTS.md.`;
