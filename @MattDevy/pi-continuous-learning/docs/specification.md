# Pi Continuous Learning - Specification

## Overview

A Pi extension (packaged as a pi-package) that observes coding sessions, records events, and uses a background Haiku process to distill observations into reusable "instincts" - atomic learned behaviors with confidence scoring and project scoping.

Inspired by [everything-claude-code/continuous-learning-v2](https://github.com/nicholasb/everything-claude-code), reimplemented as a native Pi extension in TypeScript.

## Goals

1. **Observe** - capture tool calls, user prompts, and outcomes via Pi extension events
2. **Record** - write observations to project-scoped JSONL files
3. **Analyze** - run a background job every 5 minutes using the configured analyzer provider/model to detect patterns
4. **Learn** - create/update instinct files (YAML-frontmatter markdown) with confidence scoring
5. **Apply** - inject relevant instincts into Pi's system prompt via `before_agent_start`
6. **Validate** - closed-loop feedback: track whether injected instincts align with actual session behavior, adjusting confidence based on real outcomes rather than observation count alone
7. **Manage** - provide commands to view, export, import, evolve, and promote instincts

## Architecture

```text
Pi Session
  |
  | Extension events (tool_call, tool_result, agent_end, etc.)
  v
+---------------------------------------------+
| Extension: observation collector             |
| - Captures tool use, errors, user prompts   |
| - Detects project via git remote / cwd      |
| - Tags observations with active_instincts   |  <-- feedback data
| - Writes to projects/<hash>/observations.jsonl
+---------------------------------------------+
  |
  | Every 5 minutes (setInterval in extension)
  v
+---------------------------------------------+
| Background analyzer (Pi CLI subprocess)      |
| - Spawns: pi -p --mode json --no-session     |
|   --model haiku --no-extensions --no-skills  |
|   --tools read,write                         |
| - Uses Pi's OAuth/subscription credentials   |
| - No per-request API cost                    |
| - Reads observations, writes instinct files  |
| - FEEDBACK LOOP: cross-references            |
|   active_instincts against actual behavior   |
|   to confirm, contradict, or ignore          |
+---------------------------------------------+
  |
  | Creates/updates instincts with
  | outcome-based confidence adjustments
  v
+---------------------------------------------+
| Instinct storage                             |
| - projects/<hash>/instincts/personal/*.md    |
| - instincts/personal/*.md (global)           |
| - Tracks: confirmed / contradicted / ignored |
+---------------------------------------------+
  |
  | before_agent_start event
  v
+---------------------------------------------+
| System prompt injection                      |
| - Reads high-confidence instincts            |
| - Appends to system prompt for context       |
| - Records which instincts were injected      |  <-- feeds back to observer

  src/
    index.ts                # Extension entry point (default export)
    observer.ts             # Observation collection from Pi events
    analyzer.ts             # Background analysis via Pi CLI subprocess

```

Published as a pi-package with:

```json
{
  "name": "pi-continuous-learning",
  "keywords": ["pi-package"],
  "pi": {
    "extensions": ["src/index.ts"]
  },
  "peerDependencies": {
    "@mariozechner/pi-coding-agent": "*",
    "@mariozechner/pi-ai": "*",
    "@mariozechner/pi-tui": "*",
    "@sinclair/typebox": "*"
  }
}
```

No runtime dependencies needed - the analyzer runs via Pi CLI subprocess, reusing the user's existing subscription credentials.

## Data Model

### Observation (JSONL record)

```typescript
interface Observation {
  timestamp: string;              // ISO 8601 UTC
  event: "tool_start" | "tool_complete" | "user_prompt" | "agent_end";
  tool?: string;                  // Tool name (for tool events)
  input?: string;                 // Truncated tool input (max 5000 chars)
  output?: string;                // Truncated tool output (max 5000 chars)
  session: string;                // Session ID
  project_id: string;             // 12-char SHA256 hash of git remote URL
  project_name: string;           // Directory basename
  is_error?: boolean;             // Whether tool result was an error
  active_instincts?: string[];    // IDs of instincts injected for this turn (feedback loop)
}
````

The `active_instincts` field is the key to closed-loop feedback. It is set on every observation during a turn where instincts were injected via `before_agent_start`. The analyzer uses this to cross-reference what was recommended against what actually happened.

### Instinct (YAML-frontmatter Markdown)

```yaml
---
id: prefer-functional-style
trigger: "when writing new functions"
confidence: 0.7
domain: "code-style"
source: "session-observation"
scope: project
project_id: "a1b2c3d4e5f6"
project_name: "my-react-app"
created_at: "2025-01-22T10:30:00Z"
updated_at: "2025-01-22T10:30:00Z"
observation_count: 5
confirmed_count: 3
contradicted_count: 0
inactive_count: 8
---

# Prefer Functional Style

## Action
Use functional patterns over classes when appropriate.

## Evidence
- Observed 5 instances of functional pattern preference
- User corrected class-based approach to functional on 2025-01-15
- Confirmed 3 times: agent used functional style while instinct was active
```

```typescript
interface Instinct {
  id: string; // kebab-case unique identifier
  trigger: string; // When this instinct applies
  confidence: number; // 0.3 - 0.9
  domain: string; // code-style, testing, git, debugging, workflow, file-patterns, security
  source: "session-observation" | "repo-analysis" | "imported";
  scope: "project" | "global";
  project_id?: string; // Only for project-scoped
  project_name?: string; // Only for project-scoped
  created_at: string; // ISO 8601
  updated_at: string; // ISO 8601
  observation_count: number; // How many observations led to this instinct
  confirmed_count: number; // Times behavior aligned while instinct was active
  contradicted_count: number; // Times behavior contradicted while instinct was active
  inactive_count: number; // Times instinct was active but not relevant to the turn
  title: string; // Human-readable title
  action: string; // What to do
  evidence: string[]; // Supporting evidence lines
  graduated_to?: "agents-md" | "skill" | "command"; // Graduation target (set after graduation)
  graduated_at?: string; // ISO 8601 timestamp of graduation
}
```

### Project Registry

```typescript
interface ProjectEntry {
  id: string; // 12-char SHA256 hash
  name: string; // Directory basename
  root: string; // Absolute path to project root
  remote: string; // Git remote URL (empty if none)
  created_at: string;
  last_seen: string;
}
```

## Extension Events Used

### Observation Collection

| Pi Event      | What We Capture                                   |

---

## Observation Collection (`observer.ts`)

### Event Handlers

1. **`tool_call`** - Record tool start event with tool name and truncated input. Skip observation of our own analyzer tool calls.
2. **`tool_result`** - Record tool completion with truncated output and error flag.
3. **`agent_start`** - Record user prompt text (from the event).
4. **`agent_end`** - Record session-level summary.

### Guards (Prevent Self-Observation)

- Skip recording when our own analyzer is running (track via a boolean flag)
- Skip recording for observation/instinct file operations (path-based filter)

### Secret Scrubbing

Before writing any observation, scrub common secret patterns:

- API keys, tokens, passwords, authorization headers
- Regex: `/(api[_-]?key|token|secret|password|authorization|credentials?|auth)(["'\s:=]+)([A-Za-z]+\s+)?([A-Za-z0-9_\-/.+=]{8,})/i`
- Replace matched value with `[REDACTED]`

### File Management

- Max observation file size: 10MB. When exceeded, archive to `observations.archive/` with timestamp.
- Auto-purge archived files older than 30 days (check once per session start).
- Write observations as append-only JSONL (one JSON object per line).

---

## Project Detection (`project.ts`)

Detection priority:

1. `ctx.cwd` from the extension context
2. `git remote get-url origin` - hash for portable cross-machine ID
3. `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` - fallback using repo path
4. `"global"` - if no project context detected

Project ID: first 12 characters of SHA256 hash of the git remote URL (or repo path as fallback).

Uses `pi.exec()` for git commands.

---

## Background Analyzer (`analyzer.ts`)

### Trigger

- `setInterval` running every 5 minutes (configurable) during an active Pi session
- Only runs if enough observations have accumulated (default: 20 minimum)
- Re-entrancy guard: skip if analysis is already in progress
- Session guardian: only run during active hours (8am-11pm), skip if user idle >30 min

### Why Pi CLI Subprocess (Not Direct API)

We considered three approaches:

| Approach                      | Cost                  | Complexity | Subscription           |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------- | ---------- | ---------------------- |
| `@anthropic-ai/sdk` direct    | Per-request pricing   | Low        | Needs separate API key |
| Pi SDK (`createAgentSession`) | Subscription-included | Medium     | Uses Pi's OAuth tokens |
| Pi CLI subprocess (`pi -p`)   | Subscription-included | Low        | Uses Pi's OAuth tokens |

**Decision: Pi CLI subprocess.** Reasons:

1. **No per-request cost** - uses the same Claude subscription/OAuth credentials as the main Pi session. No separate `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` needed.
2. **No extra dependencies** - no `@anthropic-ai/sdk` package needed. The analyzer just spawns the `pi` binary that's already installed.
3. **Process isolation** - the analyzer runs in a separate process, so a crash or timeout can't affect the main session. Easy to kill with SIGTERM.
4. **Proven pattern** - Pi's own `subagent` extension uses exactly this pattern (spawn `pi --mode json -p`).
5. **Self-observation prevention** - the subprocess runs with `--no-extensions --no-skills`, so our extension doesn't load in the analyzer process. No infinite loops.

The Pi SDK (`createAgentSession`) was also viable but has downsides:

- Runs in the same Node.js process - a hung analysis blocks the extension event loop
- Requires more setup (AuthStorage, ModelRegistry, ResourceLoader, SessionManager)
- Harder to timeout and kill cleanly
- Extension re-entrancy concerns (our extension loading inside its own analysis session)

### Implementation

The analyzer spawns a Pi subprocess using `child_process.spawn`:

```typescript
import { spawn } from "node:child_process";

function runAnalysis(promptFile: string, cwd: string): Promise<AnalysisResult> {
  const args = [
    "--mode",
    "json", // Structured output we can parse
    "-p", // Print mode (non-interactive, exit when done)
    "--no-session", // Ephemeral, don't save session history
    "--model",
    "claude-haiku-4-5", // Cheap, fast model
    "--tools",
    "read,write", // Only needs to read observations + write instincts
    "--no-extensions", // Prevent our extension from loading (no self-observation)
    "--no-skills", // No skill overhead
    "--no-prompt-templates", // No prompt template overhead
    "--no-themes", // No theme overhead
    "--append-system-prompt",
    promptFile, // Analysis instructions (file path)
  ];

  // The user message tells Haiku what to analyze and where files are.
  // The system prompt (in promptFile) contains the instinct format spec,
  // pattern detection rules, and confidence scoring guidelines.
  args.push(buildUserPrompt(observationsPath, instinctsDir, projectContext));

  const proc = spawn("pi", args, {
    cwd,
    shell: false,
    stdio: ["ignore", "pipe", "pipe"],
  });

  // Parse JSON events from stdout (same as subagent pattern)
  // Track tool_result_end events to see what files were written
  // Timeout after 120 seconds
}
```

The subprocess uses Pi's existing OAuth credentials (from `~/.pi/agent/auth.json`) automatically. The user's Claude subscription covers the Haiku usage at no additional cost.

### Analysis Strategy

Rather than asking Haiku for structured JSON and doing file I/O ourselves, we give Haiku the `read` and `write` tools and let it:

1. **Read** the observations file and existing instinct files
2. **Detect new patterns**: user corrections, error resolutions, repeated workflows, tool preferences
3. **Validate existing instincts** (feedback loop): for observations that have `active_instincts`, compare recommended behavior against actual behavior
4. **Write** instinct `.md` files directly to the instincts directory - creating new ones or updating existing ones with adjusted confidence and evidence

This is simpler than parsing structured output - Haiku writes the files, we just monitor for success/failure via the JSON event stream.

The system prompt instructs Haiku on:

- The exact instinct file format (YAML frontmatter + markdown)
- Where to read observations from and write instincts to
- Pattern detection heuristics for new instincts
- **Feedback analysis**: how to cross-reference `active_instincts` against observed behavior
- Confidence scoring rules (both discovery-based and feedback-based)
- Scope decision guide (project vs global)
- Rules: be conservative, only clear patterns with 3+ observations, never include code snippets

### Feedback Analysis (in the analyzer prompt)

The analyzer prompt includes a dedicated section on feedback analysis:

```markdown
## Feedback Analysis

Some observations include an `active_instincts` field listing instinct IDs that were
injected into the system prompt for that turn. Use this to validate existing instincts:

For each instinct ID in `active_instincts`, check whether the turn's tool calls and
outcomes align with, contradict, or are irrelevant to that instinct:

- CONFIRMED: The agent's behavior matches what the instinct recommends.
  Example: instinct "grep-before-edit" was active, and the agent did grep then edit.
  -> Increment confirmed_count, apply +0.05 to confidence.

- CONTRADICTED: The agent's behavior went against the instinct, OR the user
  corrected toward the opposite of what the instinct recommends.
  Example: instinct "use-functional-style" was active, but the agent wrote a class
  and the user said "yes, use a class here" or didn't correct it.
  -> Increment contradicted_count, apply -0.15 to confidence.

- INACTIVE: The instinct was injected but the turn had nothing to do with its
  trigger (e.g., a git instinct during a file-reading turn).
  -> Increment inactive_count, no confidence change.

Update the instinct file's frontmatter counters and confidence accordingly.
Add a line to the Evidence section noting the feedback outcome.

If an instinct's confidence drops below 0.1, add a `flagged_for_removal: true`
field to its frontmatter. Do not delete it - the user can review via /instinct-status.
```

### Pattern Detection

| Pattern Type       | Detection Method                             | Example                      |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| User corrections   | User prompt follows tool error or undo       | "No, use X instead"          |
| Error resolutions  | Error tool_result followed by successful fix | Build error -> fix -> pass   |
| Repeated workflows | Same tool sequence 3+ times                  | Grep -> Read -> Edit         |
| Tool preferences   | Consistent tool choice for similar tasks     | Always uses grep before edit |

### Confidence Scoring

Confidence has two sources: **discovery** (how the instinct was created) and **feedback** (whether it holds up in practice).

#### Discovery Confidence (initial)

Based on how many observations led to the instinct being created:

| Observation Count | Initial Confidence |
| ----------------- | ------------------ |
| 1-2               | 0.3 (tentative)    |
| 3-5               | 0.5 (moderate)     |
| 6-10              | 0.7 (strong)       |
| 11+               | 0.85 (very strong) |

#### Feedback Adjustments (ongoing)

Once an instinct exists and is being injected into sessions, the analyzer cross-references `active_instincts` on each observation against what actually happened. This produces three outcomes per analysis batch:

| Outcome          | Meaning                                                               | Confidence Change |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| **Confirmed**    | Behavior aligned with the instinct while it was active                | +0.05             |
| **Contradicted** | Behavior went against the instinct, or user corrected toward opposite | -0.15             |
| **Inactive**     | Instinct was active but turn wasn't relevant to its trigger           | No change         |

Additional adjustments:

- -0.05 per week without any observation (passive decay; reaches 0.1 from 0.5 in ~8 weeks)
- Cap: 0.9 maximum, 0.1 minimum (below 0.1 -> flagged for removal, auto-deleted after 7 days)

The key difference from the Claude Code version: discovery confidence is just the starting point. An instinct that was "observed 11 times" (0.85 initial) but gets contradicted in 3 subsequent sessions where it was actually injected will drop to ~0.4. Conversely, a tentative instinct (0.3) that keeps getting confirmed will climb faster because the confirmations come from real outcome data, not just "we saw something similar again."

#### Why This Matters

Without feedback, confidence is a proxy for "how often did we see a pattern." That conflates frequency with correctness. A developer might repeat a bad habit 20 times - the system would give it 0.85 confidence and start recommending it.

With feedback, confidence tracks "how often does this instinct predict or improve behavior when it's actually applied." An instinct that gets injected but consistently ignored or contradicted will decay regardless of how many times the original pattern was observed.

### Timeout and Safety

- Analysis timeout: 120 seconds (SIGTERM the subprocess)
- Max observations per analysis: 500 (tail the JSONL file before passing to Haiku)
- Max concurrent analyses: 1 (re-entrancy guard via boolean flag)
- Cooldown between analyses: 60 seconds minimum
- Subprocess killed on `session_shutdown` event

---

## System Prompt Injection (`injector.ts`)

On `before_agent_start`, load and inject relevant instincts:

1. Load project-scoped instincts (if in a project)
2. Load global instincts
3. Filter to confidence >= 0.5 (configurable threshold)
4. Sort by confidence descending
5. Take top N instincts (default: 20, configurable)
6. Format as a concise section appended to the system prompt
7. **Store the list of injected instinct IDs** in extension state so the observer can tag subsequent observations with `active_instincts`

Step 7 is the bridge that closes the feedback loop. The injector sets a module-level variable (e.g. `currentActiveInstincts: string[]`) that the observer reads when writing observations for that turn.

### Injection Format

```markdown
## Learned Behaviors (Instincts)

The following patterns have been learned from previous sessions. Apply them when relevant:

- [0.9] When modifying code: Search with grep, confirm with read, then edit
- [0.7] When writing React components: Use functional components with hooks
- [0.5] When handling errors in this project: Use Result type pattern
```

---

## Commands (`commands.ts`)

### `/instinct-status`

Show all instincts (project + global) grouped by domain, with confidence scores and feedback stats.

Displays for each instinct:

- Confidence score and trend arrow (up/down/stable based on recent feedback)
- Feedback ratio: `confirmed/contradicted/inactive` counts
- Flagged instincts highlighted for review (confidence < 0.1)

Implementation: `pi.registerCommand("instinct-status", ...)`

### `/instinct-evolve`

Cluster related instincts and suggest evolution into higher-order constructs:

- Related instincts -> skill file
- Workflow instincts -> command
- Suggest promotions from project to global

Implementation: `pi.registerCommand("instinct-evolve", ...)`

### `/instinct-graduate`

Graduate mature instincts into permanent knowledge. Scans for graduation candidates, presents proposals, and writes on user approval.

Graduation targets:

- **AGENTS.md** - Individual mature instincts become permanent guideline entries
- **Skill** - Domain clusters of 3+ instincts scaffolded into a `SKILL.md`
- **Command** - Workflow clusters of 3+ instincts scaffolded into a slash command specification

Maturity criteria (all must be met):

- Age >= 7 days
- Confidence >= 0.75
- Confirmed >= 3 times
- Contradicted <= 1 time
- Not a duplicate of existing AGENTS.md content

TTL enforcement (28 days):

- Instincts that don't graduate within 28 days are culled (confidence < 0.3) or aggressively decayed

Graduated instincts are tracked with `graduated_to` and `graduated_at` fields.

Implementation: `pi.registerCommand("instinct-graduate", ...)`

### `/instinct-export`

Export instincts to a JSON file, filterable by scope and domain.

Implementation: `pi.registerCommand("instinct-export", ...)`

### `/instinct-import <path>`

Import instincts from a JSON file with scope control.

Implementation: `pi.registerCommand("instinct-import", ...)`

### `/instinct-promote [id]`

Promote project instincts to global scope. Without ID, auto-promotes all qualifying instincts (seen in 2+ projects with confidence >= 0.8).

Implementation: `pi.registerCommand("instinct-promote", ...)`

### `/instinct-projects`

List all known projects and their instinct counts.

Implementation: `pi.registerCommand("instinct-projects", ...)`

---

## Configuration (`config.ts`)

Stored at `~/.pi/continuous-learning/config.json`:

```json
{
  "version": "1.0",
  "observer": {
    "enabled": true,
    "run_interval_minutes": 5,
    "min_observations_to_analyze": 20,
    "active_hours_start": 800,
    "active_hours_end": 2300,
    "max_idle_seconds": 1800
  },
  "injector": {
    "enabled": true,
    "min_confidence": 0.5,
    "max_instincts": 20
  },
  "analyzer": {
    "model": "claude-haiku-4-5",
    "provider": "anthropic",
    "timeout_seconds": 120,
    "max_observations_per_analysis": 500,
    "max_turns": 10
  },
  "storage": {
    "max_observation_file_mb": 10,
    "archive_retention_days": 30
  }
}
```

Defaults are used when config file is absent. The extension reads config on `session_start` and caches it. The analyzer defaults to Anthropic Haiku, but `provider` and `model` can be overridden to any Pi-registered provider/model pair.

---

## Extension Entry Point (`index.ts`)

```typescript
import type { ExtensionAPI } from "@mariozechner/pi-coding-agent";

export default function (pi: ExtensionAPI) {
  // 1. Register event handlers for observation
  // 2. Register before_agent_start for instinct injection
  // 3. Start background analyzer on session_start
  // 4. Stop background analyzer on session_shutdown
  // 5. Register all slash commands
}
```

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Extension, not shell scripts** - Pi extensions are TypeScript, have full access to Pi events, and can interact with the UI. No need for bash hooks.

2. **Pi CLI subprocess for analysis** - The background analyzer spawns `pi -p --mode json --model haiku` as a child process. This reuses the user's Claude subscription (OAuth tokens in `~/.pi/agent/auth.json`) at no additional per-request cost. No `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable needed.

3. **setInterval for scheduling** - The extension runs in Pi's Node.js process. A simple `setInterval` handles the 5-minute background job. Cleanup on `session_shutdown`.

4. **Haiku writes files directly via tools** - We give the subprocess `read` and `write` tools and instruct Haiku to read observations and write instinct files. This mirrors how the Claude Code version works and is simpler than parsing structured JSON output.

5. **`--no-extensions` prevents self-observation** - The subprocess runs with `--no-extensions --no-skills --no-prompt-templates --no-themes` so our extension doesn't load in the analyzer process. No infinite observation loops.

6. **System prompt injection via `before_agent_start`** - Pi's event system lets us cleanly append instincts to the system prompt each turn without modifying files.

7. **Storage under `~/.pi/`** - Uses Pi's conventional config location rather than `~/.claude/homunculus/`.

8. **Process isolation** - A hung or crashing Haiku analysis can't affect the main Pi session. The subprocess is killed on timeout (120s) or session shutdown.

9. **Closed-loop feedback** - The injector records which instincts were active each turn (`active_instincts` field on observations). The analyzer cross-references this against actual behavior to confirm, contradict, or mark instincts as irrelevant. This makes confidence outcome-based rather than frequency-based - an instinct that keeps getting contradicted in practice will decay regardless of how many times the original pattern was observed.

## Scope Decision Guide

| Pattern Type                   | Scope       | Examples                                                 |
| ------------------------------ | ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Language/framework conventions | **project** | "Use React hooks", "Follow Django REST patterns"         |
| File structure preferences     | **project** | "Tests in `__tests__`/", "Components in src/components/" |
| Code style                     | **project** | "Use functional style", "Prefer dataclasses"             |
| Error handling strategies      | **project** | "Use Result type for errors"                             |
| Security practices             | **global**  | "Validate user input", "Sanitize SQL"                    |
| General best practices         | **global**  | "Write tests first", "Always handle errors"              |
| Tool workflow preferences      | **global**  | "Grep before Edit", "Read before Write"                  |
| Git practices                  | **global**  | "Conventional commits", "Small focused commits"          |

Default: **project** scope. Safer to be project-specific and promote later.

## Instinct Promotion Criteria

Auto-promotion from project to global when:

1. Same instinct ID exists in 2+ different projects
2. Average confidence across projects >= 0.8
3. Domain is in the global-friendly list (security, workflow, general-best-practices)

---

## Credential and Cost Model

The analyzer subprocess runs via `pi -p`, which:

1. Reads OAuth credentials from `~/.pi/agent/auth.json` (same as the main session)
2. Uses the user's existing Claude subscription (Max plan, Team plan, etc.)
3. Haiku usage is included in the subscription - **no per-request API charges**
4. No `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable is needed
5. If the user is not logged in or has no subscription, the analyzer gracefully fails and logs a warning

This is the same credential path that Pi uses for all model interactions. The extension adds no new authentication requirements.

### Cost Estimate

Each analysis run uses roughly:

- ~500-2000 input tokens (observations + existing instincts + system prompt)
- ~500-1000 output tokens (instinct file writes)
- Running every 5 minutes during active sessions: ~12 runs/hour
- Haiku is the cheapest model available - negligible impact on subscription usage

---

## Privacy and Security

- All data stays local on the user's machine
- Secrets are scrubbed from observations before writing to disk
- Only instincts (patterns) can be exported - not raw observations
- No telemetry, no network calls except to Anthropic API for analysis
- Instinct file paths are validated against path traversal
- Instinct IDs are validated (kebab-case, no special characters)

---

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests

- `project.ts` - project detection from git remote, path fallback, hash generation
- `instincts.ts` - parse/serialize instinct files, merge logic, confidence calculations, feedback counter updates
- `observer.ts` - secret scrubbing, event filtering, observation formatting, `active_instincts` tagging
- `injector.ts` - instinct filtering/sorting, shared state for active instinct IDs
- `config.ts` - config loading, defaults, validation

### Integration Tests

- Full observation -> analysis -> instinct creation pipeline
- Feedback loop: inject instinct -> observe aligned behavior -> analyzer confirms -> confidence increases
- Feedback loop: inject instinct -> observe contradicting behavior -> analyzer contradicts -> confidence decreases
- Instinct flagged for removal when confidence drops below 0.1
- Instinct injection into system prompt
- Import/export round-trip
- Promotion workflow

### E2E Tests

- Extension loads in Pi without errors
- Commands register and execute
- Background analyzer runs on schedule
- `/instinct-status` shows feedback stats (confirmed/contradicted counts)

---

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure

- Types, config, project detection
- Storage layout creation
- Instinct file CRUD (including feedback counters: confirmed/contradicted/inactive)

### Phase 2: Observation Collection

- Event handlers for tool_call, tool_result, agent_start, agent_end
- Secret scrubbing
- JSONL file management with archival
- `active_instincts` tagging on observations (reads from injector state)

### Phase 3: Background Analyzer

- Pi CLI subprocess spawning (spawn `pi -p --mode json --model haiku`)
- Analysis system prompt construction (pattern detection + feedback analysis)
- JSON event stream parsing from subprocess stdout
- Timer management (start/stop/re-entrancy)
- Timeout handling (SIGTERM after 120s)

### Phase 4: System Prompt Injection + Feedback Bridge

- Load and filter instincts
- Format injection block
- `before_agent_start` handler
- Store injected instinct IDs in shared state for the observer to read

### Phase 5: Commands

- `/instinct-status` (with feedback stats and trend arrows)
- `/instinct-evolve`
- `/instinct-export` and `/instinct-import`
- `/instinct-promote`
- `/instinct-projects`

### Phase 6: Polish

- Session guardian (active hours, idle detection)
- Passive confidence decay over time
- Flagged-for-removal handling (instincts below 0.1 confidence)
- UI notifications for instinct creation and contradiction warnings
- Error handling and logging

### Phase 7: Graduation Pipeline

- Graduation maturity criteria as config constants
- `/instinct-graduate` command with user approval flow
- AGENTS.md writer (append graduated instinct entries)
- Skill scaffolding from domain clusters (3+ instincts)
- Command scaffolding from workflow clusters (3+ instincts)
- `graduated_to` / `graduated_at` tracking on instinct type
- TTL enforcement (28-day max age, cull or aggressive decay)
- Parser support for new graduation fields
