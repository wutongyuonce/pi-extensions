## [1.10.2] - 2026-05-20

### Changed
- Refresh npm cover (`docs/cover.{svg,png}`): align with the unified card layout used across the `@juicesharp/rpiv-*` family and push the status row below the equalizer so the recording dot, timer, and hotkey hints no longer overlap the audio bars.

## [1.10.1] - 2026-05-19

## [1.10.0] - 2026-05-19

## [1.9.2] - 2026-05-19

## [1.9.1] - 2026-05-19

## [1.9.0] - 2026-05-18

## [1.8.3] - 2026-05-18

## [1.8.2] - 2026-05-17

## [1.8.1] - 2026-05-17

## [1.3.1] - 2026-05-10

- Live audio-level equalizer bar in the overlay chrome.

### Changed
- README rewritten with feature overview, key-binding table, and configuration reference.

### Fixed
- Preflight stage tag preserved across voice-session initialization.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-05-08

### Added
- `/voice` command for local speech-to-text dictation backed by sherpa-onnx Whisper, with mic capture, live transcript overlay, and settings screen.
- Rolling partial transcript shown in real time while speaking.
- Download progress indicator with percent and byte counter on the model splash screen.
- Configurable keybinding support for the cancel action (no longer hardcoded to Escape).

### Changed
- Package marked `private: true` (opt-in install only; not part of the auto-install bundle).
- Internal constants and helper functions extracted for readability (magic numbers named, idioms centralized).

### Fixed
- Whisper spurious terminal punctuation reduced via longer VAD hangover and trailing-silence padding.
- Partial model installs are rolled back on failure; stale model directories detected and re-downloaded automatically.
- STT recognition failures logged to `~/.config/rpiv-voice/errors.log` instead of being silently swallowed.
- Download splash text uses a simplified Whisper model name.
