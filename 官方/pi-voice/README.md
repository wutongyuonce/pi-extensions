# Pi Voice

Local speech-to-text for Pi.

Press a keyboard shortcut, talk, and the resulting transcript will be put directly into your chat.

## Install

Install the npm package:

```bash
pi install npm:@earendil-works/pi-voice
```

If you prefer being on the development tip, you can install from GitHub:

```bash
pi install ssh://git@github.com/earendil-works/pi-voice
```

## Usage

The extension registers:

- a configurable terminal shortcut (`Ctrl+Alt+Z` by default) to start and stop recording;
- a `transcribe_file` tool that the agent can use to transcribe local audio or video files;
- `/voice-settings` for preferred languages, model, transcription language, microphone, and shortcut settings.

`/transcribe` remains available as a compatibility alias for `/voice-settings`. The `/voice` command is reserved for a future voice mode.

## Upgrading from pi-transcribe

It's recommended to install Pi Voice via NPM. If you have an older install of pi-transcribe uninstall it via: 

```bash
pi remove git:github.com/earendil-works/pi-transcribe
```

If you installed it into a project with `-l`, run `pi remove -l git:github.com/earendil-works/pi-transcribe` from that project instead. Then install Pi Voice with:

```bash
pi install npm:@earendil-works/pi-voice
```

## File transcription and FFmpeg

The agent can call `transcribe_file` for local audio or video files. Decoded audio is limited to 128 MiB (about 35 minutes). File decoding requires the `ffmpeg` executable. Install FFmpeg with your system package manager if you don't already have it installed

```bash
# macOS with Homebrew
brew install ffmpeg

# Debian or Ubuntu
sudo apt install ffmpeg

# Windows with winget
winget install Gyan.FFmpeg
```

If FFmpeg is installed outside `PATH`, point Pi Voice at it before starting Pi:

```bash
export PI_VOICE_FFMPEG_PATH=/path/to/ffmpeg
```

The legacy `PI_TRANSCRIBE_FFMPEG_PATH` variable remains supported when `PI_VOICE_FFMPEG_PATH` is not set.

When FFmpeg is unavailable, `transcribe_file` reports platform-specific guidance to the agent. The agent should ask before running a package-manager command. Model setup is still explicit: run `/voice-settings` once in the interactive TUI to choose and, after confirmation, download a local model.

## Developing & Building Pi Voice

To develop or run it from a checkout:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:earendil-works/pi-voice.git
cd pi-voice
npm install --ignore-scripts
pi -e .
```

If you want to be able to re-run onboarding you can enable the debug env var when starting Pi. This enables the `/voice-onboarding` command.

```bash
PI_VOICE_DEBUG=1 pi -e /absolute/path/to/pi-voice
```
