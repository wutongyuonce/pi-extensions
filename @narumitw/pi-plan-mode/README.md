# 🧭 pi-plan-mode — Codex-like Plan Mode for Pi

[![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@narumitw/pi-plan-mode)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@narumitw/pi-plan-mode) [![Pi extension](https://img.shields.io/badge/Pi-extension-blue)](https://pi.dev) [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green.svg)](./LICENSE)

`@narumitw/pi-plan-mode` adds a Codex-like `/plan` collaboration mode to Pi. Plan mode is for read-only exploration, clarifying questions, and a structured implementation-ready plan before any code mutation happens.

Pi core intentionally does not ship a built-in plan mode; this package provides one as an independently installable extension.

## ✨ Features

- Adds `/plan` to enter or manage Plan mode.
- Adds `--plan` to start a session in Plan mode.
- Enables built-in read-only tools by default while Plan mode is active.
- Disables extension and custom tools by default, with a `/plan tools` selector for explicit user-risk opt-in.
- Optionally limits `subagent` and `subagent_spawn` launches to named planning roles while Plan mode is active.
- Blocks `update_plan`, mutating built-in tools, and unsafe `bash` forms such as writes, substitutions, background jobs, dependency installs, and mutating Git commands.
- Injects Codex-like Plan mode instructions: explore first, ask decision questions for high-impact ambiguity, do not mutate files, and finalize only when decision-complete.
- Adds required `plan_mode_question` and `plan_mode_complete` tools for structured questions and completion.
- Presents the complete plan and prompts you to implement, stay in Plan mode, or exit and discard it.
- Keeps legacy `<proposed_plan>` responses compatible without advertising XML as the primary workflow.
- Shows Plan mode state in Pi's statusline as `plan active` or `plan ready`; `@narumitw/pi-statusline` adds the default `📝` icon unless configured otherwise.
- Persists Plan mode state in the Pi session so resume restores the mode.

## 📦 Install

This release requires Pi 0.80.6 or newer.

```bash
pi install npm:@narumitw/pi-plan-mode
```

Try without installing permanently:

```bash
pi -e npm:@narumitw/pi-plan-mode
```

Try this package locally from the repository root:

```

## 🚀 Usage

```text
/plan
/plan <prompt>
/plan tools
/plan show
/plan finalize
/plan implement
/plan exit
```

Use `/plan` to enter Plan mode before writing your planning prompt. Use `/plan <prompt>` to enter Plan mode and immediately submit `<prompt>` as the first Plan-mode user message. Use `/plan tools` to choose which tools are active while Plan mode is enabled; the selector is paginated at 10 tools per page. `/plan show` displays the stored plan without starting a model turn, `/plan finalize` explicitly asks the agent to complete the plan or ask one remaining material question, and `/plan implement` hands a stored plan to a normal implementation turn. `show` and `implement` fail closed when no plan is stored; `finalize` requires active Plan mode.

When Plan mode is active, ask the agent to design the change. The agent may inspect files and run read-only commands, but it should not edit files or execute the implementation. It should explore first, then use structured questions when your preference or a tradeoff materially changes the plan.

By default, Plan mode manages only Pi's built-in tools: `read`, limited `bash`, available read-only built-ins such as `grep`, `find`, and `ls`, plus the required `plan_mode_question` and `plan_mode_complete` tools. Built-in `edit` and `write` are blocked. `update_plan` is also blocked because it tracks execution progress rather than conversational planning. Extension and custom tools are disabled by default because Pi tools do not expose standardized mutability metadata; enable them from `/plan tools` only when you accept the risk for that session. For example, you can opt into `firecrawl_scrape`, `firecrawl_search`, or `lsp_diagnostics` if those extensions are loaded and you want to use them during planning.

Limited `bash` uses a fail-closed policy, including when an extension overrides the canonical `bash` tool name. It accepts common inspection commands, read-only Git and npm queries, pipelines and command lists composed entirely of accepted commands, plus selected checks such as `npm test`, `npm run typecheck`, and `cargo test`. It rejects output/input redirects, shell expansion, substitutions, subshells, background jobs, mutating flags, dependency changes, editors, and unknown commands. Tests and builds may still write ignored caches or build artifacts and may execute project-defined hooks; enable or invoke them only when the repository is trusted. This is extension-level risk reduction, not an OS sandbox.

`plan_mode_question` follows Codex's `request_user_input` pattern: the agent can ask 1-3 concise questions, each with meaningful options and a free-form Other path. If you cancel or no interactive UI is available, the agent should ask a concise plain-text question or proceed only with a clearly stated low-risk assumption instead of prematurely producing a final plan.

Pi activates tools by tool name. The `/plan tools` selector stores selections by name and shows each currently effective tool's source from Pi metadata, such as `built-in`, a user extension path, or a project extension path. If an extension overrides a built-in tool with the same name, Pi exposes the effective tool for that name and the selector shows that source.

A complete Plan mode answer should appear only after the agent has resolved discoverable facts and high-impact user decisions. The agent must call `plan_mode_complete({ plan })` alone as its final action, passing the complete Markdown plan. The tool rejects empty or whitespace-only plans and plans longer than 50,000 JavaScript characters; it does not truncate. Its visible result contains the full plan, and versioned result details let the extension restore it safely from the active session branch.

`plan_mode_complete` uses Pi's `terminate: true` hint. Termination is best effort: if a model puts it in a parallel tool batch, Pi terminates the batch early only when every finalized sibling tool also terminates. The prompt therefore requires the completion call to be standalone and last. The extension deliberately does not infer completion from phrases such as “I will present the plan,” and it does not automatically retry a turn with no plan because research and clarification turns may legitimately remain unfinished. If a turn ends without a plan, Plan mode stays active; use `/plan finalize` for explicit recovery.

Legacy sessions and models may still submit one non-empty `<proposed_plan>` block with tags on their own lines. That compatibility path remains accepted, but it is not the primary workflow. Empty, malformed, unclosed, or multiple legacy blocks keep Plan mode active and produce a warning.

After completion, `/plan` opens the ready actions when interactive UI is available. Choosing implementation—or running `/plan implement`—disables Plan mode, restores full tool access, and starts an implementation turn with the stored plan. Choosing Stay keeps the plan ready. Revision feedback starts another Plan-mode turn and clears the previous implementable plan until an updated completion arrives. For clarification-only follow-ups, the agent answers and resubmits the complete unchanged plan so it remains implementable. Exit/off discards the plan and removes its completion result from later non-Plan model context. Without interactive UI, the plan remains visible in the tool result and stored as `plan ready`; use `/plan show`, `/plan implement`, or `/plan exit` directly.

While Plan mode is enabled, the extension also publishes a compact status for Pi statuslines. With `@narumitw/pi-statusline`, this appears in the extension status area:

- `plan active`: Plan mode is enabled and still gathering context or drafting a plan.
- `plan ready`: A completed plan is stored until you implement it, continue planning, or exit Plan mode.

You can also exit directly. Direct exit discards the latest proposed plan instead of treating it as an implementation request:

```text
/plan exit
```

## ⚙️ Settings

Create `$PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR/pi-plan-mode.json` (normally `~/.pi/agent/pi-plan-mode.json`) to configure Plan mode globally. The file is optional, is read at session start, and is never created automatically.

```json
{
  "thinkingLevel": "inherit",
  "defaultPlanTools": ["read", "bash", "grep", "find", "ls", "subagent"],
  "allowedPlanSubagents": ["plan-scout", "plan-researcher", "plan-reviewer"],
  "safeSubcommands": {
    "git": ["status", "log", "rev-parse", "blame"],
    "gh": ["pr view", "pr list", "issue view", "issue list"]
  }
}
```

### Default Plan tools

`defaultPlanTools` defines the initial tool selection when a session has no stored `/plan tools` selection. Omit it to keep the available safe built-ins as the default. An explicit empty array is valid and enables only the required `plan_mode_question` and `plan_mode_complete` tools.

Tool names must be non-empty strings; duplicates are removed in first-seen order. Unknown, unavailable, and Plan-mode-blocked names are ignored when tools are activated. A tool registered after Plan mode is already active is not added automatically; re-enter Plan mode or reopen `/plan tools` to reapply the selection. Non-built-in tools named in this global setting are an explicit user-risk opt-in, just like selecting them with `/plan tools`. Pi resolves tools by name, so if an extension overrides a built-in name, the effective extension tool is selected instead. An effective tool named `bash` remains subject to the limited-shell policy regardless of its source metadata.

A selection made with `/plan tools` is stored in that Pi session and takes precedence over `defaultPlanTools` when the session resumes. The global setting remains the baseline for fresh sessions and sessions without an explicit selection.

### Allowed Plan subagents

`allowedPlanSubagents` is an optional, exact, case-sensitive allowlist of role names for subagent launches while Plan mode is active. It does not activate delegation tools by itself: add `subagent` or `subagent_spawn` to `defaultPlanTools`, or select the tool through `/plan tools`. The same role policy applies whichever activation path is used.

When configured, Plan mode checks every role in blocking `subagent` single, parallel, chain, and fan-in calls (`agent`, `tasks[].agent`, `chain[].agent`, and `aggregator.agent`) and the top-level `agent` in `subagent_spawn`. A call containing any disallowed role is rejected as a whole before the launch tool executes. Covered calls whose role fields cannot be verified are also rejected so a malformed launch cannot bypass the policy.

Omit `allowedPlanSubagents` to preserve the unrestricted role behavior for explicitly enabled delegation tools. Set it to `[]` to reject every covered launch in Plan mode. Names must be non-empty strings; duplicates are removed in first-seen order. A wrong type or an empty, whitespace-only, or non-string entry invalidates the settings file and triggers the normal warning/default fallback. Settings reload on `session_start`; removing the property removes the role restriction. Non-Plan sessions are never restricted. If no extension has registered the covered tool names, the setting is inert, so `pi-plan-mode` and `pi-subagents` remain independently installable.

This is a name check, not capability enforcement or a sandbox. `pi-plan-mode` does not inspect an allowed role's effective tools, permissions, or source. User or project definitions can change or override the meaning of an allowed name, so keep every allowed role independently read-only and retain normal project-agent trust and confirmation controls. The policy does not resolve retained agent IDs used by `subagent_send`; enabling follow-up lifecycle tools remains a separate user-risk decision.

### Safe shell subcommands

`safeSubcommands` adds reviewed command validators to limited `bash`; it is not a raw shell allowlist. Only the following exact values are accepted:

- `git`: `status`, `log`, `diff`, `show`, `branch`, `remote`, `ls-files`, `grep`, `rev-parse`, `blame`, `describe`, `merge-base`, `ls-tree`, and `cat-file`.
- `gh`: `pr view`, `pr list`, `issue view`, and `issue list`.

The first eight Git validators are built in and remain enabled when omitted, so listing them is valid but redundant. The other six Git validators and every `gh` path require an explicit opt-in. Git entries select one exact subcommand; `gh` entries select one exact two-word path, so `"pr view"` never enables `pr merge`, `pr close`, or `pr edit`. Omitted `safeSubcommands`, an empty object, and empty arrays preserve the default policy. Duplicate values are removed in first-seen order.

With the example configuration above, commands such as these are accepted:

```bash
git rev-parse --show-toplevel
git blame --no-textconv -- src/plan-mode.ts
gh pr view 218 --json number,title,state
gh issue list --state open --json number,title,state
```

The command-specific validators still reject unsafe forms, including:

```bash
git blame -- src/plan-mode.ts
git cat-file --filters HEAD
git diff
git log -Ssecret
git remote show origin
git show --ext-diff HEAD
gh pr merge 218
gh pr view 218
gh pr view 218 --web
gh pr view 218 > pr.txt
gh pr list --json number,title && gh pr merge 218
```

Redirects, shell expansion and substitution, pagers or browsers, external diff/textconv/filter/signature helpers, output flags, malformed command layouts, and any chain containing an unsafe segment fail closed. Commands that can invoke configured Git helpers implicitly require explicit guards: use `--no-textconv` with `blame`, `show`, and patch-producing or pickaxe/searching `log`; use both `--no-ext-diff` and `--no-textconv` with content-producing `diff` (`git diff --check` remains accepted); and use `git remote show -n` to avoid invoking a transport helper. GitHub CLI read paths require `--json <fields>` output so Plan mode does not rely on `GH_PAGER`, `PAGER`, or gh pager configuration. Unknown `safeSubcommands` keys or values, non-array values, and non-string entries invalidate the entire settings file and trigger the normal warning/default fallback on session start.

Read-only does not mean private: Git inspection can expose repository history and tracked secrets, while `gh` queries can expose remote repository, pull request, and issue data available to your authenticated account. The policy reduces accidental mutation and helper execution; it is not a sandbox or a confidentiality boundary.

### Thinking level

Plan mode inherits Pi's current thinking level by default. Set `thinkingLevel` to request a fixed level only while Plan mode is active. Supported values are `inherit`, `off`, `minimal`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, and `max`. The extension snapshots the prior level and restores it on exit only if the level still matches the value it applied; a manual change made during Plan mode is preserved. The setting never changes Pi's default thinking level.

Invalid settings produce a warning and fall back to inherited thinking plus the available safe-built-in tool defaults. Compatibility: a valid legacy `plan-mode.json` is migrated automatically to `pi-plan-mode.json`. If both files exist, the new filename takes precedence.

## 🧠 Codex-like behavior

This extension maps Codex's `ModeKind::Plan` behavior onto Pi's extension API:

- Plan mode is a conversational collaboration mode, not TODO/progress tracking.
- `/plan <prompt>` follows Codex behavior by switching to Plan mode before submitting the inline prompt.
- The agent should use `plan_mode_question` for important non-discoverable preferences or tradeoffs before finalizing.
- The agent completes with a standalone `plan_mode_complete` tool call instead of relying on semantic prose detection.
- `update_plan` checklist use is blocked while Plan mode is active.
- The implementation boundary is explicit: Plan mode restores tools before starting implementation, choosing implementation immediately triggers a normal agent turn with full tool access, and plain exit/off discards the stored plan.
- Pi extension safety is approximated with tool classification and fail-closed filtering for every effective tool named `bash`; other non-built-in tools remain user-selected at user risk because Pi does not expose standardized tool mutability metadata.
- Unlike native Codex, this extension uses a terminating Pi tool plus an `agent_settled` ready flow; Pi cannot provide sandbox-level enforcement.
