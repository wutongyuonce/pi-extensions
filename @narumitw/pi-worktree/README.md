# 🌳 pi-worktree — Safe Git Worktree Management for Pi

[![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@narumitw/pi-worktree)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@narumitw/pi-worktree) [![Pi extension](https://img.shields.io/badge/Pi-extension-blue)](https://pi.dev) [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green.svg)](./LICENSE)

`@narumitw/pi-worktree` adds one interactive `/worktree` command for common Git worktree operations and Pi workspace switching.

Pi cannot change its parent process working directory with `cd`. This extension performs the safe equivalent: it prepares a Pi session whose cwd is the selected worktree and switches to that session, preserving the current conversation when it has already been persisted.

## ✨ Features

- Shows compact main, linked, current, detached, locked, and prunable state in worktree selectors.
- Creates a new branch worktree or attaches an existing unoccupied local branch.
- Rejects occupied targets and unresolvable symbolic-link ancestors before Git can create a branch.
- Suggests `~/.worktrees/<main-worktree-name>/<branch>` by default and lets the user configure the root interactively.
- Optionally switches Pi into a newly created worktree while continuing the current conversation.
- Switches among existing registered worktrees through Pi's public session replacement API.
- Removes unlocked, non-current linked worktrees and preserves their branches.
- Refuses removal when tracked, untracked, manually index-flagged, submodule, or current unreachable detached-commit data may be lost.
- Allows ignored-only data such as `node_modules/` after listing it in the destructive confirmation.
- Names recovery-only administrative commits in the destructive confirmation instead of making ordinary rebase/reset history block cleanup forever.
- Always previews stale metadata before pruning it and revalidates the preview after confirmation.
- Runs Git through argv-based subprocess calls, without interpolating user input into shell commands.

## 📦 Install

```bash
pi install npm:@narumitw/pi-worktree
```

Try without installing permanently:

```bash
pi -e npm:@narumitw/pi-worktree
```

Try this package locally from the repository root:

```bash
just try-worktree
# or: pi -e ./extensions/pi-worktree
```

## 💬 Usage

Run the command without arguments:

```text
/worktree
```

Choose one action:

- **Add worktree** — enter a branch, optional start point, and optional path; confirm creation and optionally switch.
- **Switch worktree** — select another existing worktree and continue this Pi conversation there.
- **Remove worktree** — remove a linked worktree without deleting its branch; ignored-only data is listed for explicit confirmation.
- **Prune stale metadata** — inspect Git's dry-run output, then optionally run the matching prune.
- **Configure worktree root** — set a machine-local default root or submit a blank value to restore `~/.worktrees`.

The menu title shows the effective worktree root and whether it comes from the built-in default or the user settings file. `/worktree` intentionally does not accept text subcommands or expose argument autocomplete. Every change is initiated and confirmed through the interactive UI.

## 🌿 Add defaults

For a new branch, the current symbolic branch is the default start point. If Pi is running from detached HEAD, the command requires an explicit commit-ish. Git must resolve the start point to exactly one commit.

The default root is `~/.worktrees`, where `~` is Node's platform home directory. Suggestions use the registered main worktree's directory name, not the current linked-worktree cwd:

```text
main worktree: /home/user/workspace/project
branch:        feat/login
root:          /home/user/.worktrees
suggested:     /home/user/.worktrees/project/feat-login
```

On Windows, the equivalent default is such as `C:\Users\Alice\.worktrees`. Branch `/` characters become `-`. The extension does not add hashes or collision suffixes: if two normalized paths collide or the target already exists, Add stops before Git mutation.

Leave the path input blank to accept the suggestion. A custom absolute path is used directly; a custom relative path is resolved from the current Pi cwd. The target itself must not exist, and its nearest existing ancestor must resolve without a broken or looping symbolic link. Existing registered worktrees are never moved when this default changes.

The MVP does not expose `--force`, `-B`, `--detach`, `--orphan`, or lock options.

## ⚙️ Worktree root settings

The machine-local user settings file is:

```text
<getAgentDir()>/pi-worktree.json
```

For a default Pi installation this is typically `~/.pi/agent/pi-worktree.json`. Configure it through **Configure worktree root** or edit it manually:

```json
{
  "worktreeRoot": "~/worktrees"
}
```

`worktreeRoot` accepts `~`, a home-prefixed path such as `~/worktrees`, or a native-platform absolute path. It does not expand `$VAR`, `%VAR%`, or other shell syntax. Empty, relative, NUL-containing, non-string, and invalid paths are rejected. There is no project override or extension-specific environment variable.

A missing `worktreeRoot` uses `~/.worktrees`. Submitting a blank value in the interactive action removes the override. Unknown JSON fields survive interactive saves and resets. Settings reload on every `session_start`, including `/reload` and workspace replacement; a successful interactive save applies immediately to the next Add flow.

Malformed or invalid settings are warned about but never overwritten. An initial failure uses `~/.worktrees`; a later failure retains the last valid effective root. Interactive configuration remains blocked until the invalid file is fixed manually.

## 🔀 Pi workspace switching

Switching uses Pi's public `SessionManager` and `ctx.switchSession()` APIs:

1. The command waits for Pi to become fully idle so the current assistant/tool results are persisted.
2. A linear persisted session is forked into the target worktree. If `/tree` currently points at an older branch, the documented session entries for that active branch are written to the target instead, so switching cannot jump to a newer serialized leaf.
3. Pi tears down the old cwd-bound runtime and creates the target runtime.
4. The extension reports success only through the fresh replacement-session context.

If the current session is completely empty, the extension creates a valid empty Pi session for the target. If the current session is ephemeral (`--no-session`), the extension copies its active conversation branch into a persisted target session so the workspace switch does not lose context.

A successfully created Git worktree is never rolled back merely because Pi session switching fails. Re-run `/worktree` and choose **Switch worktree** after resolving the reported Pi/session issue.

## 🛡️ Safety boundaries

- The main worktree and current worktree cannot be removed.
- Locked or stale worktrees cannot be removed through this extension.
- Dirty, untracked, initialized-submodule, and intentional `assume-unchanged`/`skip-worktree` index state causes removal to fail closed. Sparse-checkout-managed `skip-worktree` entries outside the active sparsity rules are allowed when Git's rule checker can confirm them; clear other intentional index flags before removing the worktree.
- Ignored-only files and directories do not block removal. The confirmation lists them, and the extension rechecks the exact ignored inventory before Git deletes the worktree.
- A detached HEAD must be reachable from a local branch, tag, or remote ref before removal or prune.
- Removal and prune inspect reflogs, pseudorefs, per-worktree refs, and `FETCH_HEAD`. Historical commits reachable only through this administrative recovery state are listed by full OID in the destructive confirmation; approval removes those recovery pointers, so Git may later garbage-collect the commits. Create a branch or tag instead when any listed commit should survive.
- Staged-only administrative index state, a missing attached branch ref, or an unreachable current detached HEAD still blocks prune without an override.
- Removal never deletes a branch and never uses `--force`.
- Remove invokes only argv-based `git worktree remove <path>`; production runtime never invokes a shell, `rm`, `rm -rf`, or a Node filesystem directory-deletion API for worktrees.
- Prune always runs `git worktree prune --dry-run --verbose` before confirmation, inspects candidates omitted from porcelain, rechecks the exact preview and recovery-risk set after confirmation, and uses Git's default expiry. Remove likewise rechecks worktree identity, inventory, administrative path, and the approved recovery-risk set before mutation.
- The extension does not commit, push, rebase, repair, move, lock, or unlock worktrees.

Use Git directly when you intentionally need force removal, branch deletion, custom prune expiry, detach/orphan creation, move, repair, lock, or unlock behavior.

## Requirements and limits

- Git must be installed and the current Pi cwd must be inside a non-bare Git worktree.
- The command requires a UI-capable Pi mode; print and JSON modes cannot drive its dialogs.
- Project trust and cwd-bound extension/resource loading during a switch remain owned by Pi.
- The extension registers no LLM tool, background watcher, project settings, or statusline item.
