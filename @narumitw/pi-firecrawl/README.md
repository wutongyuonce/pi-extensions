# 🔥 pi-firecrawl — Firecrawl Web Scraping Tools for Pi Agents

[![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@narumitw/pi-firecrawl)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@narumitw/pi-firecrawl) [![Pi extension](https://img.shields.io/badge/Pi-extension-blue)](https://pi.dev) [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green.svg)](./LICENSE)

`@narumitw/pi-firecrawl` is a native [Pi coding agent](https://pi.dev) extension that exposes [Firecrawl](https://www.firecrawl.dev/) scraping, crawling, URL discovery, and search APIs as Pi tools.

Use it to give your AI coding agent reliable web research capabilities for documentation lookup, website audits, competitive research, content extraction, and retrieval-friendly markdown scraping.

## ✨ Features

- Scrape a single URL into markdown, HTML, raw HTML, links, screenshots, or JSON.
- Start Firecrawl crawl jobs from Pi.
- Check crawl job status and retrieve completed crawl data.
- Discover URLs with Firecrawl map.
- Search the web and optionally scrape search result pages.
- Supports Firecrawl API endpoint overrides.
- Shows statusline activity only while Firecrawl tools are running.
- Provides a `/firecrawl` menu with configuration help and tool controls.
- Provides a Plan-mode-style selector for choosing individual Firecrawl tools.
- Persists the selected Firecrawl tools across Pi restarts.
- Never logs, displays, or stores your Firecrawl API key.

## 📦 Install

```bash
pi install npm:@narumitw/pi-firecrawl
```

Try without installing permanently:

```bash
FIRECRAWL_API_KEY=fc-... pi -e npm:@narumitw/pi-firecrawl
```

Try this package locally from the repository root:

```bash
FIRECRAWL_API_KEY=fc-... pi -e ./extensions/pi-firecrawl
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

Set a Firecrawl API key before running Pi:

```bash
export FIRECRAWL_API_KEY=fc-your-key
```

Optional API endpoint override:

```bash
export FIRECRAWL_API_URL=https://api.firecrawl.dev/v1
```

`FIRECRAWL_BASE_URL` is also accepted for compatibility. The extension never logs or displays the API key.

## 🛠️ Pi tools

- `firecrawl_scrape` — scrape a single URL and return requested formats such as markdown, HTML, links, screenshots, or JSON.
- `firecrawl_crawl` — start a site crawl job and return the Firecrawl job id.
- `firecrawl_crawl_status` — check a crawl job status and retrieve completed crawl data.
- `firecrawl_map` — discover URLs for a site.
- `firecrawl_search` — search the web through Firecrawl and optionally scrape result pages.

All tools fail with a clear configuration error when `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY` is missing.

## 💬 Command

```text
/firecrawl
```

Opens a menu with configuration quick start, command usage, tool status, controls for enabling
or disabling all Firecrawl tools, and a selector for choosing individual tools.

Direct subcommands are also available:

```text
/firecrawl help
/firecrawl config
/firecrawl quickstart
/firecrawl status
/firecrawl tools
/firecrawl toggle
/firecrawl enable
/firecrawl disable
```

- `help` shows command usage.
- `config` shows API-key presence and API URL without displaying the API key value.
- `quickstart` is an alias for `config`.
- `status` shows runtime tool state, persisted selection, settings file path, API-key presence,
  API URL, and active non-Firecrawl tool count.
- `tools` opens a Plan-mode-style selector for choosing individual `firecrawl_*` tools.
- `toggle` is an alias for `tools`.
- `enable` enables all `firecrawl_*` tools for future turns.
- `disable` disables all `firecrawl_*` tools for future turns. The slash command remains
  available.

The selected tool names are saved to:

```text
${PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR:-~/.pi/agent}/pi-firecrawl.json
```

When the file is missing or invalid, the extension preserves Pi's current active-tool policy
instead of enabling tools by itself. A valid saved selection is restored on Pi startup and
`/reload`. The settings file stores only tool names and a timestamp; it never stores
`FIRECRAWL_API_KEY`, request headers, or other secrets.

Compatibility: older versions used `pi-firecrawl-settings.json`. During the migration window,
a legacy-only file is automatically migrated to `pi-firecrawl.json` with a warning. If both
files exist, `pi-firecrawl.json` wins and the legacy file is ignored. The legacy filename is
deprecated and will be removed in a future major release.

## 🚀 Examples

Scrape a page as markdown:

```json
{
  "url": "https://example.com",
  "formats": ["markdown"]
}
```

Map a small site:

```json
{
  "url": "https://example.com",
  "limit": 20
}
```

Start a crawl with markdown extraction:

```json
{
  "url": "https://example.com",
  "limit": 10,
  "scrapeOptions": {
    "formats": ["markdown"]
  }
}
```

## 🧠 Use cases

- Research documentation from inside Pi.
- Crawl websites for migration or audit tasks.
- Extract clean markdown for AI context.
- Discover URLs before scraping a site.
- Combine web search with coding-agent implementation work.
