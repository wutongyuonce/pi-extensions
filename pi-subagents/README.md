# pi-subagents

`pi-subagents` is a highly curated multi-agent framework for [Pi agent harness](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi).

It began as a fork of [HazAT/pi-interactive-subagents](https://github.com/HazAT/pi-interactive-subagents), then grew into a monumental refactor: named agents, interactive panes, background workers, async parallelism, blocking agents, child-to-parent communication, forked context, a beautiful TUI widget, orchestrator mode, and much more!

Use it when one agent should hand work to another agent instead of trying to do everything in one transcript. Interactive children open in Herdr, cmux, tmux, zellij, or WezTerm; background children run headlessly.

## Install

```bash
pi install git:github.com/edxeth/pi-subagents
```

## The model

A subagent is a named agent file plus a launch policy.

The agent file says who the child is and how it should run. The parent still owns the decision to launch it. The child owns the task it receives.

Two axes matter:

- `interactive` or `background`: where the child runs
- async or sync: whether the parent waits

`interactive` means foreground. Pi opens a visible surface through Herdr, cmux, tmux, zellij, or WezTerm. Normal launches use a backend-specific surface, such as a tab, window, split, or stacked pane.

`background` means headless. Pi starts a `pi -p` child process without opening a pane.

Async means the parent gets a “started” result and the child answer comes back later. Sync means the parent waits for the child answer before it continues.

### Interactive mux backends

Interactive children open in your current terminal backend. `pi-subagents` supports Herdr, cmux, tmux, zellij, and WezTerm.

Start `pi` inside the backend you want to use. Leave `PI_SUBAGENT_MUX` unset to let Pi detect it, or set it to `herdr`, `cmux`, `tmux`, `zellij`, or `wezterm` to force one.

The backend command must exist, and Pi must be able to see the current pane or session context. If no supported backend is active, interactive launches fail with a setup hint.

Normal launches use a backend-specific surface. Herdr keeps children beside the parent while the tab has room, then uses dedicated tabs for overflow. Every Herdr child pane is labeled with its session title, such as `[reviewer] Auth implementation review`. Other backends may use windows, splits, or stacked panes.

### Orchestrator mode

You can turn the parent session into an orchestrator — an agent that can only
delegate. It spawns sub-agents, waits for results, and synthesizes answers.
It cannot read files, run commands, edit code, or search the codebase itself.

```bash
PI_ORCHESTRATOR_MODE=1 pi
```

Export it in your shell rc to enable permanently:

```bash
export PI_ORCHESTRATOR_MODE=1
```

Enable that and two things change:

1. **Tool restriction.** Removes read, bash, edit, write,
   grep, find, and every other tool except subagent,
   subagent_kill, subagent_resume. The LLMs cannot call what they cannot see.
2. **System prompt replacement.** Pi's "expert coding assistant" prompt gets
   replaced with one that defines the orchestrator role: decompose, delegate,
   synthesize. The replacement preserves Pi's `APPEND_SYSTEM.md` content.

Children do not inherit the parent agent's role or system prompt. Each child
runs as a separate Pi process with its own agent definition and prompt chain.

#### Why orchestrator mode exists

Models default to doing work themselves. Given the chance, they read the file,
write the fix, run the test. That works for single-agent tasks. For
multi-agent workflows it defeats the purpose — you pay for two agents to race
each other, and the parent floods its context with execution details instead
of staying focused on coordination.

Every production multi-agent framework hits this same limit. Anthropic's
Claude Code has `COORDINATOR_MODE` with the same mechanism: restricted tool
set, replacement system prompt, worker isolation. OpenAI Codex users file
issues asking for a mode where the main agent "cannot execute, only
delegate." The ADCS delegation chain spec encodes it as a scope-intersection
invariant: each hop narrows permissions, never widens.

The research calls it brain/hands separation. The orchestrator holds the
plan. Workers hold the execution context. You keep them apart because mixing
them makes both worse — the orchestrator loses sight of the plan when it
starts reading files, and workers get confused about their role when they see
orchestrator-level strategy in their context.

#### When to use it

Orchestrator mode shines on tasks that decompose into parallel work:
independent research questions, multiple implementation targets, verify-after-
write cycles. The orchestrator defines the structure, dispatches each piece
to the right agent, reads results, and writes the next round of instructions.

Simple requests do not benefit. A single sub-agent handles those faster.

## Agent definitions

Agents live here:

- `.pi/agents/` in the project
- `~/.pi/agent/agents/` globally, or `$PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR/agents/` when that env var is set

Project agents override global agents with the same name.

A minimal agent:

```md
---
name: scout
description: Inspect the codebase and report the relevant files.
mode: background
auto-exit: true
tools: read,grep,find,ls
---

You are a codebase scout. Find the relevant files, read enough to be useful, and return a concise map of what matters.
```

The `description` matters. Pi uses it for ambient awareness, explained next.

For a fuller example of the intended style, see the [scout agent gist by edxeth](https://gist.github.com/edxeth/11b6a6cdf7c6068771a5e3f96ab5e34b). It shows the shape this package works best with: a sharp role, an explicit contract, and little room for interpretation.

### Frontmatter reference

| Field | Default | What it controls |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | filename | Stable agent name used by `agent: "..."` |
| `description` | unset | One-line routing hint for ambient awareness |
| `enabled` | `true` | Set `false` to hide and block the agent |
| `model` | Pi default | Child default model, including optional thinking suffix. When unset, the child inherits the parent's model. |
| `thinking` | model default | Child thinking level. When unset, the child inherits the parent's thinking level. |
| `allow-model-override` | `true` | Whether the parent Pi session may launch or resume this agent with a different model or thinking level. Leave it alone if you want to choose models per task from the parent chat. Set `false` when this agent should always use the model written in its file. |
| `allowed-models` | unset | Extra exact model refs the parent may choose when `allow-model-override` is enabled. The agent `model` is implicitly allowed and does not need to be repeated. `provider/model` allows any thinking level for that model; `provider/model:thinking` allows only that thinking level. |
| `cwd` | parent cwd | Working directory for the child |
| `extensions` | `all` | Which extension code loads in the child: `all`, `none`, or a comma-separated allowlist |
| `tools` | `all` | Child tool availability: `all`, `none`, or a comma-separated allowlist of Pi tool names. Lists may include built-in, extension/custom, and protocol tools. `none` disables built-in tools while preserving extension/custom tools unless denied. |
| `deny-tools` | unset | Final comma-separated tool names to remove from the child after built-in tools, extensions, and protocol tools are selected |
| `skills` | `all` | Child skill availability: `all`, `none`, or a comma-separated allowlist resolved by skill name |
| `inject-skills` | unset | Comma-separated skills to load into the child prompt before the task |
| `no-context-files` | `false` | Skip project context-file discovery in the child, including `AGENTS.override.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and `CLAUDE.md`. Pi loads these files independently of project approval. |
| `inherit-append-system` | `false` | Let Pi load the child's applicable global or trusted-project `APPEND_SYSTEM.md` file |
| `no-session` | `false` | Use an ephemeral child session file and delete it after completion |
| `trust-project` | `false` | Whether interactive child launches pass Pi's `--approve` flag and trust project-local files/settings. Background children always generate `--no-approve` for safety; use `flags` only as an explicit advanced override. |
| `auto-exit` | `false` | Close the child after a normal completion |
| `system-prompt` | task body | `append` adds the agent body to the child's own Pi system prompt (Pi's default unless the child has an applicable `SYSTEM.md`); `replace` replaces that base prompt with the agent body. The parent agent's system prompt is never inherited. |
| `session-mode` | `lineage-only` | `standalone`, `lineage-only`, or `fork` |
| `flags` | unset | Extra CLI flags passed to the child pi process (e.g. `--verbose` or `--some-custom-flag`). Appended after all generated args — last-wins semantics against conflicting generated args, including `--approve` / `--no-approve`. Use only as an advanced escape hatch for extension-registered flags or pi built-in flags not covered by other frontmatter fields. |
| `env` | unset | Line-based `KEY=VALUE` pairs passed as environment variables to the child process. Use YAML block syntax for values with commas or `=`. `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` is special: when set here, it is resolved before launch and becomes the child's Pi config/session root. `~/` is expanded. Internal PI vars such as PI\_SUBAGENT\_\* still take precedence if names conflict. |
| `deny-env` | unset | Comma- or newline-separated environment variable names that the child does not inherit from the parent. `*` is a wildcard. Names that match nothing are ignored. Values set with `env` are never filtered. |
| `task-expansion` | unset | Set `shell` when the task may include shell placeholders that Pi resolves before launch. Pi runs each placeholder from the child's target `cwd`, gives it 30 seconds, replaces it with captured output, and gives that prepared task to the child. The command receives `PI_WORKSPACE`; long output is cut with `[output truncated]`. Leave unset unless you trust the task text to execute shell commands. |
| `context-warn-threshold` | `off` | Send the sub-agent a wrap-up warning when its context window reaches this percentage (`1%`–`99%`). Two more warnings follow at each `context-warn-step` above it. Example: `80%` warns at 80%, 85%, and 90%. |
| `context-warn-step` | `5%` | The percentage gap between each warning (minimum `1%`). A warning above 99% moves down to 99% so it still arrives before compaction. Decimals round down. |
| `report-context-usage` | `true` | Add the child's final context use to the result that the parent receives. |
| `timeout` | unset | Whole seconds for the whole run. Pi stops the child at this limit. Omit for no limit. |
| `idle-timeout` | unset | Whole seconds without output from the child. Pi stops the child at this limit. Omit for no limit. |
| `llm-as-a-verifier` | `false` | `true` turns every launch into a best-of-N run: several attempts in isolated git worktrees, an LLM verifier picks the best one, the parent gets one result. See [LLM-as-a-verifier](#llm-as-a-verifier). |
| `llm-as-a-verifier-candidates` | `3` | Number of attempts per launch. Integer `>= 2`; the upper bound is the spawn-width ceiling (16). |
| `llm-as-a-verifier-model` | none — **required** | The verifier model: `provider/model[:thinking]` (example: `deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash:high`) or a profile name (example: `fast` loads `.pi/agents/verifiers/fast.md`). The backend must return API logprobs. |
| `llm-as-a-verifier-criteria` | `generic` | What the verifier judges by: a built-in name (`generic`, `code-change`, `research`), your own criteria file by name (`fix-focus` loads `.pi/agents/criteria/fix-focus.md`), or a path. |
| `timeout-warn-threshold` | `false` | Reserve the remainder of the first threatened limit for reporting. At this percentage (`1%`–`99%`), the parent interrupts the active child and restarts the same session in report-only mode. `true` means `80%`. Decimals round down. Any other value turns the policy off. |
| `on-timeout` | `report` | What the parent can do after a limit stops the child. `report` keeps `subagent_resume` available, and the new run gets the same limits. `block-resume` refuses the resume. Any other value fails to load. |
| `spawning` | `false` | Let this child launch subagents of its own. `true` lets it launch any agent. A comma-separated list of agent names (for example `spawning: researcher, reviewer`) lets it launch only those agents. |
| `spawn-depth` | `1` | How many levels of subagents may run below this child. Each subagent it launches gets one less. A subagent left with `0` has no launching tools, so the chain stops. Omit to use the default. |
| `spawn-width` | omitted | The most subagents this child may run at the same time. Must be a positive whole number. Omit for no limit (a hard ceiling of 16 always applies). |
| `visible-to` | `all` | Who may launch this agent: `all` (anyone), `root` (only the top-level session), or a comma-separated list of agent names. |
| `async` | `true` | `false` makes the launch sync |
| `mode` | `interactive` | `interactive` pane or `background` process |
| `parent-close-policy` | `terminate` | What happens to the child when the parent session exits: `terminate` (kill) or `continue` (leave running) |

Use YAML block syntax for more than one env var:

```yaml
env: |
  PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR=~/.pi-scout/agent
  PI_SAFETYNET_DEFAULT_MODE=explore
  SOME_VALUE=value,with,commas
```

Pi splits `env` by line. It does not split values by comma. When you set `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR`, the child uses that directory for its Pi config and sessions. For per-agent Herdr or Zellij placement, set `PI_SUBAGENT_HERDR_PLACEMENT` or `PI_SUBAGENT_ZELLIJ_PLACEMENT` here. The parent reads placement before the child pane exists. See [Herdr placement](#herdr-placement) and [Zellij placement](#zellij-placement).

Children inherit every environment variable from the parent Pi process, in every launch mode. This includes API keys and tokens that you exported before you started Pi. `deny-env` in an agent file removes names from this inheritance. You can also set `PI_SUBAGENT_ENV_DENY` in the parent environment. Both lists apply.

`trust-project` controls Pi's project-local trust boundary for resources such as settings, extensions, skills, prompts, themes, `SYSTEM.md`, and `APPEND_SYSTEM.md`. The default `false` passes `--no-approve`, even when the parent project was previously approved. Project context files are separate: Pi still loads applicable `AGENTS.override.md`, `AGENTS.md`, or `CLAUDE.md` files unless `no-context-files: true` passes `--no-context-files`. Background children always generate `--no-approve`; `flags` is the explicit advanced escape hatch if you need to override that safety default.

`task-expansion: shell` prepares task context before launch for small models that should not have to plan tool calls. It is opt-in because the parent task text becomes shell input and runs in the parent Pi process before the child starts. Commands execute in source order from the child's effective `cwd`; each placeholder gets 30 seconds before Pi inserts a timeout diagnostic. Use `$PI_WORKSPACE` or `${PI_WORKSPACE}` inside the shell command to read the workspace path from the environment. This explicit opt-in works in every parent mode, including orchestrator mode. Use explicit shell placeholders:

````md
Summarize the files changed.

Inline status: !`git status --short`

Changed files:
```!
git diff --name-only
```

Follow these conventions:
!`cat daily-git-brief.md`
````

Pi expands those placeholders into command output before writing the child task artifact. Ordinary Markdown code fences are treated as literal examples, so inline placeholders inside language-tagged code fences such as `sh` or `text` do not execute. Plain standalone lines like `!git status` are not expanded; use inline ``!`git status` `` or a fenced shell command block. Because project-local agent files can opt into this behavior, only use `task-expansion: shell` in agents whose launch tasks you trust to become shell input.

`context-warn-threshold` turns on context warnings for a child agent. The child process checks how full its context window is after each completed model turn, once the full tool-result batch is visible, and again when the agent finishes. If the total crosses a threshold, the child sends itself a warning for the next model turn.

Warnings are advisory: the model needs another successful turn to act on one. A single unbounded tool batch can jump from below the first threshold directly into Pi's native compaction or context-overflow recovery before the child can wrap up. Keep tool output bounded; the warning policy does not replace output truncation or Pi's compaction safeguards.

Each warning shows the token count and the percentage, for example `160K/200K tokens (80.0%)`. The three warnings get more urgent, so the child stops new work and returns its best result before the context compacts.

Both fields take whole percentages. Decimal values round down. Omit the field, or set `context-warn-threshold: off`, to turn the warnings off.

```yaml
---
name: researcher
context-warn-threshold: 80%
---
```

With the default `5%` step, `80%` warns at 80%, 85%, and 90%. Set `context-warn-step: 10%` to space them at 80%, 90%, and 99%. (The third lands at 100%, so it moves down to 99% to arrive before compaction.) If usage crosses two or more thresholds in one turn, Pi sends only the most urgent one. The child holds each warning only while its usage stays at or above that percentage. A reload at the same usage does not repeat a warning, but a drop below the threshold — after compaction, for example — releases it, so a child that keeps working is never left without warnings.

A child that wraps up on the **last** warning did what it was told, so the parent must not read the short result as a premature exit. Pi marks that case in the result it sends to the parent:

```text
Sub-agent context: 182K/200K tokens (91%) used at finish. It stopped early as
instructed by its context-warning policy: check what is unfinished and launch a
fresh sub-agent for it if needed. A short or partial report here is expected and
not a failure. Do not resume this session; resuming re-does already-summarized
work and wastes a turn.
```

Only the last warning counts. A child that sees an earlier warning and then finishes its work normally is reported as an ordinary completion, and stays resumable. A child that fails with a provider error is reported as a failure, never as an instructed wrap-up.

A child that fails after the last warning is a failure, not a wrap-up, so the parent keeps the cheap retry. Its result says the context window is spent and that a fresh sub-agent is usually better, and `subagent_resume` still works on it. Only a warning-driven wrap-up is blocked.

Warnings only ever come in three stages, and the last stage is the one that says to stop. A setting that cannot reach three stages, such as `context-warn-threshold: 99%`, still warns the child but never blocks it, because the child was never told to stop.

Warned results also omit the `Resume: pi --session …` line, so the parent is not handed a command that would bypass the block below. The session path is still shown.

`report-context-usage: false` hides the token counts but still reports the early stop, because a parent that does not know the reason resumes a child that cannot work.

`subagent_resume` also refuses such a session, because resuming it gives the child no room to work. You can still resume it yourself from the `/subagents` overlay.

### Stop a runaway child with time limits

Every child runs with no time limit. `timeout` and `idle-timeout` are two separate limits. You can set one, both, or neither.

```yaml
---
name: scout
timeout: 900
idle-timeout: 180
timeout-warn-threshold: 80%
---
```

`timeout` is a clock on the whole run. It starts when the child process or pane launch begins. Inherited fork history consumes zero seconds of this clock. Use it for a child that can work forever without finishing.

`idle-timeout` measures time without output. Use it for a child that stops working and never reports, for example one that waits inside a tool that never returns.

Only the child's own work counts as output. Its messages and completed tool results count. A message that Pi writes into the child's session does not count. Time inside one long tool call counts as silence, because the call has not produced a result.

That last rule is the purpose of the field. A child stuck inside a tool call is what `idle-timeout` catches. But a slow build looks the same to Pi. Set `idle-timeout` higher than the slowest tool call the child makes.

The idle clock starts at launch, not at the child's first word. A child that hangs before it says anything must also be caught. Set the value high enough for the process start and the first model reply. A few tens of seconds is the smallest useful value.

Both fields take whole seconds. If the value is not a positive whole number, the agent file fails to load. A typo must not become "no limit", because that is the problem the field prevents.

Both limits work for a background child and for a child in a pane. For a background child, Pi sends `SIGTERM` to the process group. Five seconds later Pi sends `SIGKILL`, but only while the process group is still alive. For a child in a pane, Pi closes the pane, because there is no separate process to signal. If the close fails, Pi tries again. If every try fails, the result says so.

When both limits are set, neither resets the other. The first hard limit reached stops the child. If `timeout-warn-threshold` is enabled, the first soft threshold reached starts one wrap-up phase; the other soft threshold no longer starts a second one.

#### Reserve time for a final report

`timeout-warn-threshold` is off until you set it. It is an enforced soft deadline, not a queued advisory steer.

The child receives its clock contract before its first model call. It includes the launch timestamp and says explicitly that inherited or forked conversation consumed zero seconds. The child must use the supplied timestamps instead of estimating elapsed work from transcript length.

At the threshold, the parent acts from its own process:

1. For a background child, it terminates the child process group.
2. For an interactive child, it closes the child pane.
3. It reopens the same session with forced auto-exit and a report-only prompt.
4. The child extension blocks every new tool call in that continuation.
5. The original hard deadline stays fixed. Restart time comes out of the reserved remainder.

This is why a long-running tool or custom TUI cannot suppress the wrap-up. Pi normally delivers a steer only after active tool calls finish, and synchronous child code can block the child's event loop. The parent does not wait for either path.

The wrap-up child reads a standalone message shaped like this:

```text
This clock belongs to the current logical sub-agent run. A process restart for
wrap-up does not reset it. Conversation inherited or forked when the original
child was spawned consumed zero seconds of it. The elapsed and remaining values
below are authoritative; do not infer time from the transcript.

Time limit: you have been running for 720s, and your limit is 900s for this
whole run. About 180s remain. At the limit the system stops you, and work you
did not report is lost. Stop taking on new work. Report your result now, even
if it is incomplete.

The parent runtime interrupted your previous active operation at the warning
threshold so the remaining time is reserved for this report. Do not retry the
interrupted tool, call any tool, or begin new work. Summarize
only the committed work visible in this session and report what remains
unfinished.
```

For `idle-timeout`, the hard deadline that triggered the wrap-up is pinned. Output from the report-only continuation does not buy a fresh full idle interval.

`no-session: true` remains ephemeral. When this policy is enabled, Pi temporarily persists that child to its private session path so it can restart after the interrupt, then deletes the file after the final result. The parent still does not expose a resumable session.

If the wrap-up completes, the parent receives a result such as:

```text
Sub-agent "scout" completed its time-limit wrap-up (12m 3s). The parent
interrupted its active operation at 80% of its whole-run limit so the remaining
time was reserved for this report. A short or partial report is expected; check
what remains unfinished.

Mapped the auth flow. The session layer still needs verification.
```

The wrap-up is a normal completion, not a hard timeout. Its session stays resumable unless another policy blocks it.

The trade-off is deliberate: a legitimate slow tool is cancelled at the threshold. If losing that tool run is worse than losing the final report, leave `timeout-warn-threshold` off and use only the hard limits.

#### What the parent receives

A stopped child cannot report its own result, so the parent reports it:

```text
Sub-agent "scout" ran out of time, so the system stopped it after 15m. Its
agent file sets a limit of 15m for the whole run.

Partial work from before it stopped. It is incomplete, so check it before you
trust it:

Mapped the auth flow. The session layer is untouched.

A sub-agent that used its whole limit once usually does it again. A resume gets
the same limit, so it can stop at the same point. It is usually better to
finish the work yourself, or to start a new sub-agent with a smaller task.

Session: /path/to/child.jsonl
To continue this work, use the subagent_resume tool. It applies the same limit
again. Do not open this file with a plain pi --session command, because that
run has no limit.
```

#### Resume after a stop

A resume is allowed by default. A time limit means that the child ran out of clock. It does not mean that the session is broken.

A resumed run gets the same limits as the first run. A child that loops stops again at the same point instead of running forever. This is why a resume is safe to allow.

Use the `subagent_resume` tool to continue the work. A plain `pi --session` run is not a tracked child, so that run has no limit.

Set `on-timeout: block-resume` when a second partial run is not safe. An example is an agent that writes to something outside the repository. Then `subagent_resume` refuses the session, and the result hides the session line from the model. You can still resume the session yourself from the `/subagents` overlay.

`parent-close-policy: continue` remains intentionally detached. If the parent exits, it no longer owns either timeout clock, so strict enforcement is no longer guaranteed for that surviving child.


### Report final context use to the parent

`report-context-usage` controls one line in the child result. The default value is `true`.

With the default value, the parent receives a result such as this:

```text
Sub-agent "scout" completed (3s).

Reviewed the authentication flow and found the files that require changes.

Session: /path/to/child.jsonl
Resume: pi --session /path/to/child.jsonl

Sub-agent context: 145K/200K tokens (72%) used at finish.
```

The last line shows the context use when the child finished. The parent can use this number before it resumes the child.

Set the field to `false` to remove the last line:

```yaml
---
name: scout
report-context-usage: false
---
```

The parent then receives this result:

```text
Sub-agent "scout" completed (3s).

Reviewed the authentication flow and found the files that require changes.

Session: /path/to/child.jsonl
Resume: pi --session /path/to/child.jsonl
```

This field changes only the text that the parent receives. The TUI still shows the context use to the user.

Named-agent frontmatter wins over duplicate launch-time fields such as `tools`, `cwd`, and `mode`. `model` and `thinking` are different: while you are in a parent Pi session, you can ask Pi to run a subagent with a specific model or thinking level for that one launch or resume. That works by default. If an agent file sets `allow-model-override: false`, Pi ignores those per-launch model choices and uses the model from the agent file, or the inherited Pi model if the file does not name one. Use that opt-out for agents whose quality, cost, or safety depends on a specific model.

Use `allowed-models` when an agent should have a small exact model menu:

```yaml
---
name: reviewer
model: zai/glm-5.1:high
allow-model-override: true
allowed-models: openai/gpt-5.5:low, nahcrof/glm-5.1:off, anthropic/claude-opus-4-8
---
```

`model` is the default and is always allowed. `allowed-models` lists the other models Pi may use for this agent, so you do not need to repeat `model`. The `:thinking` suffix is optional: `provider/model:low` allows only that thinking level, while `provider/model` allows the model with whatever thinking level Pi resolves. If `allow-model-override: false`, Pi ignores launch-time and resume-time model choices as usual.

## LLM-as-a-verifier

This implements the [LLM-as-a-Verifier](https://github.com/llm-as-a-verifier/llm-as-a-verifier) technique ([paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2607.05391), [Python library](https://pypi.org/project/llm-verifier/)): the agent runs several attempts at the task in parallel, and a second LLM picks the best one.

```yaml
---
description: Best-of-N implementation worker
model: zai/glm-5-turbo:high
llm-as-a-verifier: true
llm-as-a-verifier-candidates: 3
llm-as-a-verifier-model: deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash
llm-as-a-verifier-criteria: code-change
---
```

### What happens on a launch

1. Pi checks that the source tree is a clean Git repository. Then each attempt gets its own [git worktree](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-worktree). A worktree is a private copy of the repo. It separates the file changes of each attempt. It is not a sandbox: paths outside the repo, the network, and shared services stay shared. All attempts get the same task.
2. When the attempts finish, the verifier LLM reads what each attempt did. It scores the attempts against the criteria file. At least two attempts must give different results. If all attempts give the same result, or the verifier cannot tell them apart, the run fails. Nothing is applied to your tree.
3. You get one result: the report of the winning attempt, plus a short footer. If the winner changed code, the change is staged in your working tree. It is not committed. Inspect it with `git diff --staged`. If your tree changed during the run, nothing is applied, and the winner stays on a Git branch that the footer names.

A run continues if you close or reload the parent session: a detached supervisor owns it end-to-end. The report is delivered only to the session that launched the run, or an ancestor of it — whichever starts next — and waits on disk until then. To stop a run early, kill the child with `subagent_kill` from the launching session; other sessions are refused unless you confirm the cancel yourself in the `/subagents` overlay.

The verifier makes many small API calls: a 3-attempt run with the `code-change` criteria makes about 72 calls. Budget accordingly.

### The verifier model

You must set `llm-as-a-verifier-model`. If you do not, the launch fails and the agent asks you what to use. The agent does not pick a model for you and does not edit your files.

You write one of two forms:

- **`llm-as-a-verifier-model: provider/model`** — pick the model directly. Example: `deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash`. Add `:high` for more reasoning, `:low` for less: `deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash:high`.
- **`llm-as-a-verifier-model: name`** — pick a profile file. Example: `fast` loads `.pi/agents/verifiers/fast.md` from your project, or the same file under your global Pi directory. A profile holds the same things you would write in the field, plus an env block for a server you run yourself (vLLM, llama.cpp):

```yaml
# .pi/agents/verifiers/lab.md
---
model: qwen3-32b
env: |
  OPENAI_BASE_URL=http://10.0.0.5:8000/v1
  OPENAI_API_KEY=whatever-the-lab-uses
---
```

Where the URL and key come from, in order:

1. The env block of the profile, if you used one.
2. The provider entry in your Pi config: `models.json`, then `models-store.json` (what Pi's `/login` wrote).
3. Your exported `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` or `VERTEX_API_KEY` alone. The library then calls the official DeepSeek or Google Vertex endpoint.
4. Your exported `OPENAI_BASE_URL` (and `OPENAI_API_KEY` if the server needs one). This serves providers that Pi does not know, such as your own vLLM or llama.cpp server for example.

One rule holds everywhere: a provider named in the field always uses its own URL. A stray `OPENAI_BASE_URL` in your shell never redirects a deepseek or gemini choice. If nothing names a working URL, the launch fails with an error that says what to set.

#### Which backends work

The library speaks one format: the OpenAI Chat Completions API with `logprobs` (the [OpenAI `logprobs` field](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/object)). The verifier reads these numbers to score attempts.

- Works: OpenAI, DeepSeek, Google Vertex (Gemini), and any self-hosted OpenAI-compatible server (vLLM, SGLang, llama.cpp).
- Does not work: Anthropic and other non-OpenAI formats (no library client), and most proxies and aggregators (they strip the logprobs field).

Before anything is paid for, Pi sends one small request to the backend you chose. If the backend does not return usable logprobs, the launch stops there. That one request is the only cost of a wrong pick.

### Criteria

`llm-as-a-verifier-criteria` sets what the verifier judges by. Three built-in templates ship with the extension: `generic` (the default), `code-change`, and `research`.

- **Your own file** — a bare name loads `.pi/agents/criteria/<name>.md` from your project, or the same file under your global Pi directory. A project file with a built-in name replaces that built-in.
- **Path** — a value with a `/` in it is a path, relative to the launch directory.

## Ambient awareness

Ambient awareness is the quiet note Pi gives the parent model about available agents.

Pi stores that note as a hidden custom message. The user does not see it as chat. The LLM sees it as context before it decides whether to call `subagent`.

The note contains agents with `description` fields and labels each one by what the child would see:

- `isolated context` means the child starts clean. The parent must write a self-contained task.
- `forked context` means the child sees the parent transcript. The parent can rely on context already in the chat.

Pi sends ambient awareness once when a top-level session first needs it, then sends a fresh copy after reload if the agent list changed.

Normal child sessions do not receive ambient awareness, even with `spawning: true`. They sit under a parent that made the first routing decision. A `standalone` child can receive its own ambient awareness because Pi treats it as a root session.

Agents without descriptions remain launchable, but they do not appear in ambient awareness.

## Launching and waiting

Async launch:

1. parent calls `subagent`
2. child starts
3. parent receives a “started” result
4. child result comes back later by steer

Sync launch:

1. the agent has `async: false` in frontmatter
2. parent waits
3. tool result contains the child result

#### Mixed sync and async batches

When one tool-call batch contains at least one sync/blocking subagent, the whole batch becomes a barrier. Pi still launches every child with its own frontmatter, so an `async: true` child keeps async launch metadata for resume, but the parent waits until every child in that batch completes and receives all results as tool results.

```
subagent(sync), subagent(async), subagent(async) → all launch
→ parent waits until all three finish
→ returns all three completed results
```

Pure async batches stay detached: the parent receives started results and child results arrive later by steer.

After a pure async launch, the parent should get out of the way unless it has separate work. If the parent keeps solving the delegated task, you paid for two agents to race each other.

By default, a successful async launch ends the parent turn after the current tool batch. The children keep running. Their results come back later.

Leave `PI_SUBAGENT_DISABLE_COORDINATOR_ONLY_TURN` unset, or set it to `0`, to keep that guard. Set it to `1` when you want the parent model to keep going after async launches.

```bash
PI_SUBAGENT_DISABLE_COORDINATOR_ONLY_TURN=1 pi
```

That only removes the runtime stop. The parent still owns only work it did not delegate.

## Session modes

A child session has two questions:

- should Pi attach it to the parent session tree?
- should the child model see the parent transcript?

`lineage-only` attaches the child to the tree and starts the model clean. This is the default. You keep lineage, resume paths, and artifact attribution without copying the whole parent chat.

`standalone` starts clean and skips the parent link. Use it for unrelated work.

`fork` attaches the child to the tree and copies parent context. Use it when the child needs decisions, files, or prior results already in the parent transcript.

The `isolated context` and `forked context` labels from ambient awareness describe model memory. They do not describe where Pi stores the child in the session tree. A `lineage-only` child is still a child of the parent session even though its model starts clean.

For nested launches, `parent` means the session that spawned the child:

```text
top-level session
└── child session
    └── grandchild session
```

### Forked sessions

A fork copies the entire parent session into a new child run. The child inherits all user messages, assistant responses, tool calls, and tool results from the parent transcript.

When the parent model has a larger context window than the child model, the inherited history may exceed what the child can fit. Pi handles this automatically — the child's native compaction trims inherited messages at LLM call time using the child model's actual context window and tokenizer. No manual budget configuration is needed.

A fork also gets a handoff marker. Pi appends a short system-prompt note, then writes a hidden custom message with a `<subagent-boundary>` tag at the end of the copied transcript. The tag says: the old messages are background, and the next user message is the child task.

That marker prevents a common failure. A child can read the parent's old role, old tools, or old task and start acting like the parent. The marker tells it where the fork begins.

The marker also steers the model. If you want a raw fork with no marker and no boundary instruction, set:

```bash
PI_SUBAGENT_DISABLE_CHILD_CONTEXT_BOUNDARY=1
```

### `no-session: true`

`no-session: true` gives the child a temporary session file and deletes it after completion.

For `fork`, Pi seeds that temporary file with the parent session content. For `lineage-only`, Pi also gives the child inherited context because there is no persistent child file where it can store lineage metadata.

Use `no-session: true` for disposable children. Do not use it when you need resume, `caller_ping`, or durable child history.


## Child lifecycle

A child can finish in three ways.

### `auto-exit`

Use `auto-exit: true` for autonomous agents. The child exits after a normal assistant completion.

Once the operator interrupts (Escape) or sends input to the child, auto-exit is permanently disabled for that session — the child warns the operator and stays open. Run `/auto-exit` inside the child to re-arm it: the next normal assistant completion closes the child again. Background children never receive operator input and are unaffected.

### `subagent_done`

Manual-lifecycle children get a `subagent_done` tool. The child writes its final assistant message, calls `subagent_done`, and Pi returns that final message to the parent.

Pi hides `subagent_done` for `auto-exit: true` agents. If you want an interactive child that only the operator can close, add `subagent_done` to `deny-tools`.

### `caller_ping`

Use `caller_ping` when the child needs the parent. The child sends a message up, exits, and leaves a session file that the parent can resume.

## Resuming child sessions

`subagent_resume` starts an existing child session again. You can pass a follow-up task.

Resume tries to preserve the original launch shape: mode, model, prompt style, cwd, tools, extensions, and lifecycle settings. A resumed child should continue as the same child, even if the agent file changed after the first launch.

One exception: attempt sessions of an `llm-as-a-verifier` launch are never resumable — their worktree copy is removed after the winner is picked. `subagent_resume` refuses with a dedicated error; launch the agent again instead.

## Child output

The child's final assistant message is its output.

For large output, let the child use Pi's `write` tool and mention the path in its final message.

## Child tools and extensions

`extensions`, `tools`, and `deny-tools` shape the Pi capabilities available to the child model. They are not a sandbox for untrusted code. Loaded extensions still execute with the child process permissions, and freeform `flags` can override generated CLI arguments. Use OS or container isolation for hard security boundaries.

Children load all extensions by default. Omit `extensions` or set `extensions: all` for the default Pi extension set.

Set `extensions: none` to launch with no normal extensions. `pi-subagents` still injects its mandatory internal helper so child lifecycle and result delivery continue to work.

Set a comma-separated allowlist when you want a smaller child environment.

```md
---
name: reviewer
extensions: .pi/extensions/safe-tools.ts, npm:@foo/bar
---
```

When `extensions` is `none` or an allowlist, Pi launches the child with `--no-extensions`, injects the subagent protocol helper, then loads only the allowlisted extensions.

For an unversioned `npm:` source that is already configured and installed in the child's effective Pi settings, pi-subagents reuses Pi's managed package directory instead of creating a second temporary CLI installation. Exactly matching configured Git sources are reused too, including the same explicit ref when one is present. Resolution uses Pi's settings and package APIs, so it respects the child's Pi config root and configured `npmCommand` such as Bun. Unconfigured, filtered, explicitly versioned, and tagged npm sources retain Pi's normal temporary `-e` behavior; Git sources that do not exactly match the configured source do the same. Project-installed packages are reused only when the child's final approval flags trust the project.

Local paths stay paths. Package and remote sources keep their normal prefixes when managed reuse does not apply:

```md
---
name: reviewer
extensions: ./extensions/local.ts, npm:@foo/bar, git:github.com/user/repo
---
```

### Child skills

`skills` controls which skills the child Pi process can use.

```md
---
name: reviewer
skills: all
---
```

`skills: all` is the default. Pi keeps its normal skill discovery: project skills, global skills, settings, packages, and extension-provided skills.

```md
---
name: reviewer
skills: none
---
```

`skills: none` launches the child with `--no-skills`. The child has no discovered skills, and `inject-skills` is not allowed.

```md
---
name: reviewer
skills: pua,torpathy
---
```

A comma-separated list is an allowlist. `pi-subagents` resolves each name through Pi's resource loader, then launches the child with `--no-skills --skill <resolved-path> ...`. Only those named skills are available.

`skills` resolves names from the same places Pi sees skills, including:

- `.pi/skills/`
- `.agents/skills/`
- global skill directories
- settings and package resources
- skills bundled by extension packages listed in `extensions`

Package skill example:

```json
{
  "name": "my-pi-package",
  "pi": {
    "extensions": ["./extensions"],
    "skills": ["./skills"]
  }
}
```

An agent can allowlist a skill from that package by loading the package and naming the skill:

```md
---
name: reviewer
extensions: ./path/to/my-pi-package
skills: packaged-reviewer
---
```

`inject-skills` controls which available skills start inside the child task context.

```md
---
name: reviewer
skills: pua,torpathy
inject-skills: torpathy
---
```

`inject-skills` reads the selected `SKILL.md` files, strips frontmatter, and prepends `<skill>` blocks to the child task artifact. Multiple injected skills appear in order before the task. The child gets one startup task, so it cannot answer between injected skills and the task.

Injected skills must be available under `skills`. These fail before launch:

```md
skills: none
inject-skills: pua
```

```md
skills: pua
inject-skills: torpathy
```

By default, injected skills use Pi's native skill shape:

```xml
<skill name="pua">
References are relative to /path/to/pua.

...skill body...
</skill>
```

If [`pi-better-skills`](https://github.com/edxeth/pi-better-skills) is loaded for the child, injected skills use its path-context shape:

```xml
<skill name="pua">
<skill_context>
  <skill_dir>/path/to/pua</skill_dir>
  <workspace_dir>/path/to/workspace</workspace_dir>

  <path_policy>
    Relative file references in this SKILL.md normally resolve from skill_dir when they exist there.
    Plain workspace commands like git status and bun test usually run in the workspace unless instructed otherwise.
    Use $PI_SKILL_DIR/path for explicit bundled skill files.
    Use $PI_WORKSPACE/path for explicit workspace/project files.
  </path_policy>
</skill_context>

...skill body...
</skill>
```

Load `pi-better-skills` like any other child extension:

```md
---
name: researcher
extensions: git:github.com/edxeth/pi-better-skills
skills: deep-research
inject-skills: deep-research
---
```

The `tools` field narrows the child to a Pi tool allowlist. Use built-in names such as `read` and `bash`, extension/custom names such as `mcp`, and protocol names such as `caller_ping` when they should be part of the final allowlist. Pi-subagents keeps required child protocol tools available in narrowed allowlists. The optional `set_tab_title` protocol tool is added only when `PI_SUBAGENT_ENABLE_SET_TAB_TITLE=1`. When `tools` is omitted or set to `all`, Pi keeps its default active tool set. When `tools` is `none`, Pi disables built-in tools while preserving extension/custom tools unless you deny them.

Pi silently ignores `--tools` names that are not registered by a built-in or a loaded extension. That means a typo (for example `tools: read,edti`) leaves the child silently without `edit`. pi-subagents surfaces a non-blocking warning in the subagent result when a name is within one edit of a built-in (`edti`→`edit`, `raed`→`read`); the launch still proceeds, because a near-miss name can be a legitimate custom tool (for example `hash` is one edit from `bash`). pi-subagents cannot validate arbitrary extension/custom tool names before the child loads its extensions, so ensure every custom/extension name in `tools:` is registered by an extension listed in `extensions:`.

> **Allowlisted `skills:` need a tool named `read`.** Pi core renders the `<available_skills>` block in the child's system prompt only when the active tool set includes `read` (it checks `selectedTools.includes("read")`). If you narrow `tools:` to swap Pi's native file tools for an extension's replacements and drop `read`, every allowlisted (non-injected) skill becomes invisible to the child even though its files exist on disk. Keep the built-in `read` in `tools:` when a child relies on allowlisted skills. `inject-skills` is unaffected — injected skills are pasted into the task text directly. Note that some tool extensions re-inject skills through their own path and may not need `read`; check how yours handles skills.

`deny-tools` is a final named tool denylist. It can remove built-in Pi tools, extension/custom tools, or pi-subagents protocol tools after they have otherwise been selected.

```md
---
name: reviewer
tools: read,grep,mcp
extensions: npm:pi-mcp-adapter
deny-tools: bash,edit,write,ask_user
---
```

By default a child cannot launch subagents: `spawning` is `false`, which removes its `subagent`, `subagent_resume`, and `subagent_kill` tools. Set `spawning` only on agents that coordinate others. The four fields above define what such a child may do; this section adds the rules the table cannot show.

`tools:` narrows the child's work tools; it does not revoke a spawn grant. When `spawning` is enabled, `subagent`, `subagent_resume`, and `subagent_kill` stay available alongside a narrowed `tools:` list, exactly like `caller_ping` and `subagent_done`. Use `deny-tools` (or leave `spawning` off) to take them away.

`spawn-depth` is what stops two agents that launch each other from looping forever: the allowance drops by one at each level and never rises. `spawn-depth` and `spawn-width` bound a single burst of launches; they do not cap total token use over a long conversation. These fields are guardrails, not a security sandbox — a child that has `bash` or arbitrary extensions can still run `pi` itself.

Two environment variables set global ceilings when you start Pi: `PI_SUBAGENT_SPAWN_DEPTH` and `PI_SUBAGENT_SPAWN_WIDTH`. An agent file can tighten these for its own subtree but never raise them.

A child's launch allowances are saved in its launch metadata and narrowed again on resume — resuming never restores a larger allowance, and the first metadata entry is authoritative, so a child cannot grant itself more by writing to its own session file.
## Parent shutdown policy

Set `parent-close-policy` in the agent frontmatter:

```yaml
---
name: scout
parent-close-policy: continue
---
```

| Value | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `terminate` | Stop the child when the parent session exits |
| `continue` | Leave the child running and stop delivering its result to the closed parent |

The default is `terminate`.

## UI

The parent session gets a live widget above the editor. It shows running children, elapsed time, activity, and context usage.

Every `subagent` call requires both a strict `name` and a short `title`.

- `name` is the machine handle used in launch/result text and kill/wait targeting. Use lower-kebab `<scope>-<role>`, 2-4 words, max 32 characters: `auth-scout`, `diff-reviewer`, `session-tester`.
- `title` is the human label shown in the widget/session UI. Use sentence-case prose, 3-8 words: `Auth implementation map`, `Local diff bug review`.

Child sessions can also get session titles like:

```text
[scout] Auth flow reconnaissance
```

Disable child session titles with `PI_SUBAGENT_DISABLE_SESSION_TITLES=1`.

## Launching children through a wrapper

By default, the extension launches children with the same Pi entrypoint it can infer from the parent. If your real Pi command goes through a wrapper, set it:

```bash
PI_SUBAGENT_PI_COMMAND="my-wrapper pi" my-wrapper pi
```

The wrapper applies to new children and resumed children. Quoted paths work:

```bash
PI_SUBAGENT_PI_COMMAND="'/path with spaces/my-wrapper' pi" pi
```

## Environment variables

User-facing knobs:

| Variable | Use |
| --- | --- |
| `PI_ORCHESTRATOR_MODE` | Set `1` to turn the parent into an orchestrator (delegation-only tools, replacement system prompt) |
| `PI_SUBAGENT_PI_COMMAND` | Launch children through a wrapper command |
| `PI_SUBAGENT_MUX` | Force `herdr`, `cmux`, `tmux`, `zellij`, or `wezterm` |

| `PI_SUBAGENT_DISABLE_COORDINATOR_ONLY_TURN` | Set `1` to let the parent keep running after async launches |
| `PI_SUBAGENT_DISABLE_CHILD_CONTEXT_BOUNDARY` | Set `1` for raw forks with no boundary marker |
| `PI_SUBAGENT_DISABLE_SESSION_TITLES` | Disable automatic child session names |
| `PI_ARTIFACT_PROJECT_ROOT` | Override internal artifact storage root |
| `PI_SUBAGENT_SHELL_READY_DELAY_MS` | Change the fixed pane startup delay before Pi sends the child command (default: 500ms) |
| `PI_SUBAGENT_ENABLE_SET_TAB_TITLE` | Register the optional `set_tab_title` tool |
| `PI_SUBAGENT_RENAME_TMUX_WINDOW` | Let `set_tab_title` rename the tmux window |
| `PI_SUBAGENT_RENAME_TMUX_SESSION` | Let `set_tab_title` rename the tmux session |
| `PI_SUBAGENT_HERDR_PLACEMENT` | Herdr policy: `auto`, `right-stack`, `down-stack`, `right`, `down`, or `tab` |
| `PI_SUBAGENT_HERDR_MIN_COLUMNS` | Minimum columns preserved by Herdr `auto` placement (default: `50`) |
| `PI_SUBAGENT_HERDR_MIN_ROWS` | Minimum rows preserved by Herdr `auto` placement (default: `12`) |
| `PI_SUBAGENT_ZELLIJ_PLACEMENT` | Zellij policy: `auto`, `right-stack`, `down-stack`, `floating`, or `tab-stack` |
| `PI_SUBAGENT_ZELLIJ_MIN_COLUMNS` | Minimum usable columns for each side of a Zellij split (default: `50`) |
| `PI_SUBAGENT_ZELLIJ_MIN_ROWS` | Minimum usable rows for each side of a Zellij split (default: `10`) |
| `PI_SUBAGENT_LLM_VERIFIER_CANDIDATES` | Default candidate count for `llm-as-a-verifier` agents that do not set `llm-as-a-verifier-candidates` |

Runtime internals you may see while debugging:

- `PI_DENY_TOOLS`
- `PI_SUBAGENT_EXTENSIONS`
- `PI_SUBAGENT_NAME`
- `PI_SUBAGENT_AGENT`
- `PI_SUBAGENT_PARENT_SESSION`
- `PI_SUBAGENT_SESSION`
- `PI_SUBAGENT_SURFACE`
- `PI_SUBAGENT_AUTO_EXIT`
- `PI_SUBAGENT_LLM_VERIFIER_VENV` (llm-as-a-verifier: pre-provisioned `llm-verifier` venv root)
- `PI_SUBAGENT_SUPERVISOR_RUNTIME` (llm-as-a-verifier: command that runs the detached supervisor `.ts` entry)

Live test knobs:

- `PI_SUBAGENT_ALLOW_LIVE_WINDOWS`
- `PI_SUBAGENT_LIVE_MODEL`
- `PI_SUBAGENT_KEEP_E2E_TMP`
- `PI_SUBAGENT_LIVE_LOCK_PATH`
- `PI_SUBAGENT_ALLOW_VERIFIED_E2E` (llm-as-a-verifier live e2e; also needs `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`)
- `PI_SUBAGENT_PROVIDER_RECOVERY_DELAYS_MS` — override the provider-error recovery backoff windows (comma-separated ms, e.g. `10000,11000,12000`) so a live Pi process can exercise the wait → nudge → kill path without waiting the full 30/60/90s. Values below 10000ms are clamped so recovery does not race Pi's own default auto-retry backoff. Defaults to the production `30000,60000,90000`.

## Herdr placement

Herdr uses `auto` placement by default. The first child shares the parent tab when both panes remain usable. Later children split the largest pane owned by that parent. Herdr chooses right or down from the pane geometry and opens a dedicated child tab when no safe split remains.

Set `PI_SUBAGENT_HERDR_PLACEMENT` to change the policy:

- `auto`: balance owned panes while preserving the configured minimum size, then use dedicated tabs for overflow.
- `right-stack`: open the first child to the right and split later siblings downward.
- `down-stack`: open the first child below and split later siblings to the right.
- `right` or `down`: split the parent in that direction for every launch. These explicit policies can create small panes.
- `tab`: always open a dedicated child tab.

`auto` preserves at least `PI_SUBAGENT_HERDR_MIN_COLUMNS` columns and `PI_SUBAGENT_HERDR_MIN_ROWS` rows in both halves of a proposed split. The defaults are `50` columns and `12` rows. The check happens before Herdr creates the pane, so a small window goes straight to a tab instead of producing an unreadable terminal.

Every pane-backed Herdr child receives its session title as the pane label. When a child uses the optional `set_tab_title` tool, Herdr updates that child pane without renaming the shared parent tab or workspace. Dedicated overflow tabs keep the original child session title.

Placement ownership stays inside the parent Pi process. Separate Pi parents cannot overwrite each other's placement state, even when they share one Herdr socket. A failed split or pane rename must leave at most one child surface before tab fallback begins.

The parent environment sets the default for all interactive subagents. An agent can override the placement policy for its own launches through the existing [`env`](#agent-definitions) frontmatter:

```yaml
env: PI_SUBAGENT_HERDR_PLACEMENT=tab
```

The parent reads this value before it creates the child surface. The agent value overrides the parent default. `PI_SUBAGENT_HERDR_MIN_COLUMNS` and `PI_SUBAGENT_HERDR_MIN_ROWS` remain parent-wide settings. On resume, a persisted per-agent `env` value wins; without one, the current parent default wins, then the originally persisted policy is the fallback.

## Zellij placement

Zellij groups children by their immediate parent session. The first child splits that parent; later siblings stack on the same pane. Set `PI_SUBAGENT_ZELLIJ_PLACEMENT`:

- `auto` (default): split the parent pane when there is room, otherwise open a dedicated tab. Later siblings stack on the first pane owned by that parent.
- `right-stack`: first child goes right, siblings stack there.
- `down-stack`: first child goes below, siblings stack there.
- `floating`: each child opens as a pinned floating pane.
- `tab-stack`: first child opens a dedicated tab, siblings stack in that tab.

`right-stack`, `down-stack`, and `auto` fall back to a dedicated tab when a split would fall below `PI_SUBAGENT_ZELLIJ_MIN_COLUMNS` or `PI_SUBAGENT_ZELLIJ_MIN_ROWS`.

The parent environment sets the default for all interactive subagents. An agent can override it for its own launches through the existing [`env`](#agent-definitions) frontmatter:

```yaml
env: PI_SUBAGENT_ZELLIJ_PLACEMENT=down-stack
```

This is a parent-read exception to the usual child-environment contract because placement must be resolved before the child pane exists. The agent value overrides the parent default. Placement groups are scoped by immediate parent and resolved policy, so agents with different policies do not overwrite each other's stack anchors. On resume, a persisted per-agent `env` value still wins; without one, the current parent default wins, then the originally persisted policy is the fallback.

Zellij 0.44.x needs a short focus transaction for directional and stacked placement, and stacked insertion changes client focus. Those policies require exactly one attached Zellij client. With more clients, use `floating` or detach the extras.

## Testing

Unit tests:

```bash
bunx tsc --noEmit
npm test
```

Herdr-focused fake tests:

```bash
node --test test/mux/herdr.test.ts
node --test test/mux/herdr-placement.test.ts
node --test test/launch/herdr-interactive-launch.test.ts
```

The mux tests cover Herdr detection, adapter errors, geometry-aware placement, small-window tab fallback, owned-pane isolation, pane titles, explicit policies, split limitations, I/O, and cleanup. The launch test covers Herdr parity for cwd, env, flags, trust-project approval, session settings, model and thinking resolution, tool narrowing, skills, lifecycle policy, and explicit `PI_SUBAGENT_MUX=herdr` selection.

Live tests:

```bash
PI_SUBAGENT_ALLOW_VERIFIED_E2E=1 DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=... npm run test:e2e-live-verified-fanout
PI_SUBAGENT_ALLOW_LIVE_WINDOWS=1 npm run test:e2e-live-blocking
PI_SUBAGENT_ALLOW_LIVE_WINDOWS=1 npm run test:e2e-live-mix-blocking
npm run test:e2e-live-deny-tools
npm run test:e2e-live-tools
npm run test:e2e-live-extensions
npm run test:e2e-live-stop-after-turn
```

The live window tests require an explicit opt-in because they open real terminal windows.

Herdr live smoke tests are guarded and bounded:

```bash
npm run test:live-herdr-mux
npm run test:live-herdr-pi
npm run test:live-herdr-timeout-wrap-up
```

Without opt-in variables, each Herdr smoke prints a `SKIP` line and exits before creating Herdr surfaces. Use the skip output as guard evidence only. It is not a real live smoke run.

Run the real Herdr mux smoke only when you are ready to create temporary Herdr surfaces:

```bash
PI_SUBAGENT_ALLOW_LIVE_WINDOWS=1 npm run test:live-herdr-mux
```

Run the real Pi Herdr smoke with both live opt-ins and a model. This script starts an interactive parent Pi session inside a Herdr-managed pane. It does not use `pi -p` as proof of interactive child behavior.

```bash
PI_SUBAGENT_ALLOW_LIVE_WINDOWS=1 \
PI_SUBAGENT_LIVE_MODEL=provider/model[:thinking] \
npm run test:live-herdr-pi
```

Run the enforced timeout wrap-up smoke with the same opt-ins. It blocks an interactive child inside a synchronous custom tool, verifies that Herdr closes that pane at the threshold, observes a replacement report-only pane on the same session, and requires the replacement to finish before the original hard deadline.

```bash
PI_SUBAGENT_ALLOW_LIVE_WINDOWS=1 \
PI_SUBAGENT_LIVE_MODEL=provider/model[:thinking] \
npm run test:live-herdr-timeout-wrap-up
```

All Herdr smoke scripts check the `herdr` command, server running status, and protocol compatibility before mutating panes. They label created tabs and panes with a unique marker, then close marked surfaces during cleanup.

Herdr validation record for this release:

- `node --test test/mux/herdr.test.ts` passes the fake Herdr mux contract suite.
- `node --test test/launch/herdr-interactive-launch.test.ts` passes the fake Herdr launch parity suite.
- `bunx tsc --noEmit` passes type checking.
- `npm test` runs the registered Herdr mux and launch suites through the repository test entrypoint.
- `npm run test:live-herdr-mux` and `npm run test:live-herdr-pi` pass their skip guards when `PI_SUBAGENT_ALLOW_LIVE_WINDOWS` and `PI_SUBAGENT_LIVE_MODEL` are unset. A real live run requires the opt-in variables above.
