# rpiv-btw architecture

Module layout, what the extension registers with Pi, how the overlay is laid out,
how state is stored, and how the package tolerates different Pi host versions.

## Modules

```
rpiv-btw/
├── index.ts             — entry; registers the command + 3 hooks
├── btw.ts               — state, snapshots, threading, the model call
├── btw-budget.ts        — history cap + branch fit
├── btw-messages.ts      — BtwTurn + message-text extractors
├── btw-ui.ts            — bottom-anchored overlay and key handling
├── pi-compat.ts         — host-tolerant pi-ai /compat loaders
└── prompts/btw-system.txt — system prompt for the side call
```

Pi discovers the extension through the manifest block in `package.json`:

```json
"pi": { "extensions": ["./index.ts"] }
```

That is the entire registration surface. The package ships no skills, no agents,
no `bin`, and declares no `exports` or `main`. A test (`ship-manifest.test.ts`)
asserts that the published `files` list covers every production module.

## What gets registered

One slash command:

| Command | Description string |
| --- | --- |
| `/btw <question>` | `Ask a side question without polluting the main conversation` |

Three lifecycle hooks:

| Event | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `message_end` | Snapshots the branch, only for assistant messages whose `stopReason` is not `toolUse` |
| `session_compact` | Invalidates this session's cached snapshot |
| `session_tree` | Invalidates this session's cached snapshot |

No tools are registered. No CLI flags are added.

## State

All state lives on a single process-wide cell:

```ts
export const BTW_STATE_KEY = Symbol.for("rpiv-btw");
```

It holds two maps — `histories` and `snapshots` — both keyed by
`ctx.sessionManager.getSessionFile()`, with `memory:<sessionId>` as the fallback
key when there is no session file.

Using `globalThis` plus `Symbol.for()` (the same idiom OpenTelemetry uses for
cross-import-graph singletons) means the cell survives module re-import, so
`/btw` history outlives `/new`, `/fork`, `/resume`, and `/reload`. It is lost
when the Pi process exits — by design. Nothing is persisted to disk, and the
package reads no environment variables and no config files.

## Overlay

`showBtwOverlay` mounts a `Component` through `ctx.ui.custom` with these options:

| Option | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `anchor` | `bottom-center` |
| `width` | `100%` |
| `maxHeight` | `85%` (`BTW_MAX_HEIGHT_RATIO = 0.85`) |
| `margin` | `{ left: 0, right: 0, bottom: 0 }` |

Render order, top to bottom:

```
banner        — your question on a themed stripe, padded to full width
(blank)
history       — prior "/btw <q>" lines for this session
echo          — "/btw <q>" for the current question
(blank)
answer        — "…" while pending, the answer text, or the error in red
(blank)
footer        — key hints
```

History and echo use a 2-column left gutter; the answer body uses 4. The panel
grows upward with content. When the natural height exceeds
`floor(terminalRows × 0.85)` (terminal rows default to 24 if unknown, with a
floor of 4 rows), it clips from the top and `↑`/`↓` scroll that window —
offset `0` shows the newest content.

### Keys and footer gates

| Key | Action | Matching |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Esc` | Aborts the in-flight call and dismisses the overlay | `matchesKey` (ANSI + Kitty) |
| `↑` | Scroll up one row, clamped at 0 | `matchesKey` |
| `↓` | Scroll down one row, clamped to the overflow amount | `matchesKey` |
| `x` | Clears this session's `/btw` history and resets scroll | raw `data === "x"` — uppercase `X` is not bound |

| Footer hint | Shown when |
| --- | --- |
| `↑/↓ to scroll` | the call is no longer pending (an answer or error has arrived) |
| `x to clear history` | this session has at least one prior `/btw` turn |
| `Esc to dismiss` | always |

Hints are joined with `" · "` and truncated to the panel width.

## Host-version tolerance

pi-ai resolves at runtime against the *host's* copy (all three pi peers are
declared `"*"`), and pi moved the global dispatch API to a `/compat` entrypoint
in 0.80.1. `pi-compat.ts` therefore resolves `completeSimple` lazily:

1. `import("@earendil-works/pi-ai/compat")` — pi >= 0.80.1.
2. On a **module-resolution** failure only, fall back to
   `import("@earendil-works/pi-ai")` — pi <= 0.79.x, which has no `/compat`
   subpath at all.

The fallback is gated on the error codes `ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED`,
`ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND`, and `MODULE_NOT_FOUND`, walked down the `cause` chain
(bounded at 16 links, because ESM loaders and test mock layers nest the real
code). Any other `/compat` error — the entrypoint exists but throws at module
init — rethrows, so a real failure surfaces instead of being masked by a root
import that may not have the export.

If neither entrypoint exposes the function, the call fails with
`pi-ai does not expose completeSimple on /compat or the package root — unsupported host pi-ai version`.

`/compat` is documented upstream as temporary, so this module is the single place
to migrate when it is removed.

## Messages and errors

Every notify and overlay error string the package can produce:

| String | When |
| --- | --- |
| `/btw requires interactive mode` (error) | `ctx.hasUI` is false — `pi --print`, RPC |
| `Usage: /btw <question>` (warning) | the argument is empty or whitespace-only |
| `/btw requires an active model` (error) | there is no `ctx.model` |
| `/btw model (<provider>:<id>) is misconfigured: <err>` | credential lookup returned an error |
| `/btw model (<provider>:<id>) has no API key available.` | lookup succeeded but the API key is empty |
| `/btw call failed: <err ?? "unknown error">` | the completion returned `stopReason: "error"` |
| `/btw call threw: <message>` | the completion threw and the call was not aborted |
| `/btw returned no text content.` | the response contained no text parts |

The first three are `ctx.ui.notify` toasts raised before the overlay opens; the
rest render inside the overlay in the error style.

## Boundaries

- **No runtime dependencies.** No `dependencies`, no `devDependencies` — only the
  three `@earendil-works` peers.
- **No sibling imports at runtime.** `pi-compat.ts` deliberately duplicates
  rpiv-core's `isModuleNotFound` rather than importing it, because the rpiv
  packages never import each other at runtime.
- **Standalone.** rpiv-btw is excluded from `rpiv-pi`'s auto-install sibling list,
  and a test asserts that exclusion.
