/**
 * Host-version-tolerant loader for pi-ai's `completeSimple`.
 *
 * Pi >= 0.80.1 moved the global dispatch API (`completeSimple` et al.) to the
 * "@earendil-works/pi-ai/compat" entrypoint; hosts <= 0.79.x export it from
 * the package root and have no /compat entrypoint at all. pi-ai resolves at
 * runtime against the HOST's copy (peerDependency "*"), so neither path can
 * be a static import — try /compat first, fall back to the root entrypoint.
 *
 * The fallback is reserved for RESOLUTION failures (the /compat subpath does
 * not exist on this host); any other /compat error — the entrypoint exists but
 * throws at module init — rethrows so the real failure surfaces at the call
 * site instead of being masked by a root import that may lack the export.
 *
 * /compat is documented as temporary (deleted with pi's ModelManager
 * migration); when that lands, this module is the single place to migrate.

 * credential-derived request fields — OAuth tokens for keyless providers,
 * GitHub Copilot's OAuth-specific `baseUrl`. Older hosts, and future hosts
 * that move the slot, simply fall through to the legacy global completion
 * path below. Mirrors rpiv-advisor's bridge — duplicated because siblings
