## [Unreleased]

## [2.11.0] - 2026-09-21

## [2.10.1] - 2026-09-13

## [2.10.0] - 2026-09-12

### Fixed

- **The dictation UI no longer freezes while a decode runs.** `recognizer.decode()` ran Whisper inference synchronously on the shared event loop, so the TUI froze for the length of every decode. Recognizer construction and decode now ride napi async work (`OfflineRecognizer.createAsync` / `decodeAsync`), keeping the splash render and the overlay responsive. Because a final decode can now still be in flight when the user commits, the session drains the finals chain before pasting to the editor; the drain races a 10 s timeout that falls back to the reducer merge (leaving an `stt.drain` breadcrumb), and commit teardown orders drain-then-abort so a drain-time failure still reaches `errors.log`. Once the signal is aborted the pipeline skips stranded decode work outright, and post-abort rejections no longer land in the error log as failures.
- **Decodes serialize on the one native recognizer handle.** `SttEngine.recognize` FIFO-serializes calls, so a rolling partial and a chained final can no longer overlap on the handle sherpa holds no lock over.
- **A settings save no longer reverts JSON-only keys.** Save handlers merge the draft against `voice.json` as read at save time, so a mid-session hand edit of a key the settings screen does not own round-trips instead of silently reverting.

### Added

- **`numThreads` in `voice.json`** tunes the recognizer's decode threads (default 4, integer 1–16, clamped). It is JSON-only: the settings screen shows it read-only and passes it through on save. Decode calls leave `stt.decode` latency breadcrumbs in the diagnostic log, and the diagnostic-log table documents the new `stt.decode` / `stt.drain` rows.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-05-08

- Rolling partial transcript shown in real time while speaking.
- Download progress indicator with percent and byte counter on the model splash screen.
- Configurable keybinding support for the cancel action (no longer hardcoded to Escape).

### Changed
- Package marked `private: true` (opt-in install only; not part of the auto-install bundle).
- Internal constants and helper functions extracted for readability (magic numbers named, idioms centralized).

### Fixed
- Whisper spurious terminal punctuation reduced via longer VAD hangover and trailing-silence padding.
- Partial model installs are rolled back on failure; stale model directories detected and re-downloaded automatically.
- STT recognition failures logged to `~/.config/rpiv-voice/errors.log` instead of being silently swallowed.
- Download splash text uses a simplified Whisper model name.
