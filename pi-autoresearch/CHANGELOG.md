# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

## [1.7.0] - 2026-08-31

### Changed

- **Breaking:** no keyboard shortcuts are bound by default anymore. The fullscreen dashboard default chord `ctrl+shift+f` collided with pi 0.84.2's new built-in transcript search (#86) — and any hardcoded default will eventually collide with a future pi built-in. Shortcuts are now strictly opt-in via `<agent-dir>/extensions/pi-autoresearch.json`. To restore the old behavior: `{ "shortcuts": { "fullscreenDashboard": "ctrl+shift+f" } }`.

### Added

- `/autoresearch dashboard` subcommand opens the fullscreen dashboard overlay — the keyboard-free way to reach it.
- The `export` (`/autoresearch export`) and `off` (`/autoresearch off`) actions can now be bound to opt-in shortcuts alongside `fullscreenDashboard`.
- README guidance (aimed at agents) for verifying a chord against the installed pi's built-in keymap before writing it to the shortcut config.

## [1.6.2] - 2026-07-09

### Changed

- Raised the autoresearch auto-resume ceiling from 20 to 200 turns, while adding a stuck-loop override that stops auto-resume after more than 20 consecutive `discard` or `crash` results in the current segment.

## [1.6.1] - 2026-07-02

### Fixed

- Redirected `workingDir` logs no longer auto-activate autoresearch in unrelated pi sessions.
- `/autoresearch off` now persists across `/tree`, compaction, and reloads: a manual off is recorded as a session activation decision and is no longer overridden just because `log.jsonl` still exists.

## [1.6.0] - 2026-06-08

### Changed

- Autoresearch now stores session files under the `.auto/` subfolder by default, with legacy file fallback for existing sessions.
- The dashboard widget is now always expanded — the full results table renders inline above the editor at all times. Removed the collapsed one-liner mode and the `Ctrl+Shift+T` expand/collapse toggle (and its `shortcuts.toggleDashboard` config key). Fullscreen (`Ctrl+Shift+F`) remains the only dashboard toggle.
- Migrated Pi package imports and dependencies from the `@mariozechner` npm scope to `@earendil-works`.

## [1.5.0] - 2026-06-04

### Changed

- The `init_experiment`, `run_experiment`, and `log_experiment` tools are now revealed to the agent only while autoresearch mode is active, instead of being callable in every session. Outside autoresearch mode the tools are absent from the LLM's schema and system prompt, so the agent can no longer self-start a research loop — entry is via `/autoresearch` or resuming a session with an existing `autoresearch.jsonl`.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-05-06

### Added

- Configurable dashboard keyboard shortcuts. Users can now override or disable the toggle and fullscreen shortcuts with a profile-aware `<agent-dir>/extensions/pi-autoresearch.json` config file, helping autoresearch coexist with other pi extensions that bind the same keys.
- Shortcut resolution tests covering defaults, overrides, disabled shortcuts, partial configs, malformed configs, and extension registration.

### Changed

- Dashboard hints and README documentation now reflect the effective shortcuts from config.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-04-29

### Added

- Deterministic compaction summary. When pi compacts context, autoresearch now bypasses the LLM summarization and injects a lossless markdown summary built from persisted state (experiment rules, ideas backlog, and last 50 runs with ASI fields). This eliminates information loss across compaction boundaries.
- Recent-run deltas in the compaction summary use the full segment baseline, not just the first visible run in the window — percentages stay accurate even for long sessions.
- New test coverage for compaction summary assembly, empty state, re-init segments, 50-run cap, and hidden-baseline delta correctness.

### Fixed

- Post-turn auto-resume no longer tells the agent "don't re-read files" when no compaction happened. Split into two resume messages: a generic one for normal turns and a compaction-specific one that correctly references the summary.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-04-28

### Changed

- Long-running loops now ride pi's auto-compaction instead of stopping. When pi summarizes older messages on context overflow, autoresearch detects the resulting idle and re-prompts the agent to re-read `autoresearch.md`, the tail of `autoresearch.jsonl`, `autoresearch.ideas.md`, and `git log` before continuing.

### Fixed

- Manual `/compact` mid-iteration no longer leaves the loop stuck. `session_compact` now schedules a fresh resume even when no `agent_end` fired for the interrupted turn (so no `pendingResumeMessage` was waiting to be rescheduled). Same fix covers split-turn auto-compactions.
- Compaction during agent setup (before the first `log_experiment`) now resumes. The post-turn gate still requires an experiment this turn to avoid resuming on plain chat replies, but the post-compaction gate is permissive — compaction itself is evidence the loop should continue.
- Rapid back-to-back compactions all resume. Dropped the 5-minute auto-resume cooldown that was sized for a different threat model (chat-only `agent_end` loops); the experiment-this-turn gate plus `MAX_AUTORESUME_TURNS = 20` already cover the looping cases the cooldown was guarding against.

### Removed

- Removed the next-iteration token-cost prediction and its `isContextExhausted` guard — pi's auto-compaction handles overflow, so autoresearch no longer needs to estimate or stop early.
- Removed the `iterationTokens` field from `ExperimentResult` and `autoresearch.jsonl`. Existing log files remain readable; the field is simply ignored. The `token-budget.sh` hook example, which relied on it, has been dropped.
- Removed the never-shipped `autoCompactResume` config option (it was opt-in for an earlier draft of this change).

## [1.1.1] - 2026-04-28

### Added

- Published to the npm registry. Install with `pi install npm:pi-autoresearch`.
- Releases now publish automatically from GitHub Actions via npm trusted publisher (OIDC) with provenance attestation.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-04-24

### Added

- Added optional `autoresearch.hooks/before.sh` and `autoresearch.hooks/after.sh` lifecycle hooks for prospective and retrospective iteration automation.
- Added the `autoresearch-hooks` skill plus example hook scripts for research fetching, learnings capture, notifications, anti-thrash, and idea rotation.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-04-22

### Fixed

- Updated the default dashboard shortcuts to `Ctrl+Shift+T` (toggle) and `Ctrl+Shift+F` (fullscreen).
- Avoided the shortcut conflict with Pi's built-in `Ctrl+X` binding introduced in newer Pi releases.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-04-20

### Added

- Initial stable release of `pi-autoresearch`.
