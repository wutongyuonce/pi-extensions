/**
 * Structural analyser behind the availability-policy coverage gate (#1476).
 *
 * The first cut of this gate was a bag of regexes over file text, and a review
 * broke it seven different ways in one sitting: a `Map<string, boolean>` cache,
 * a field called `installed`, a `let cached` closure, a probe flag hoisted into
 * a const, `["-v"]` instead of `["--version"]`, a `?: boolean` field with no
 * initialiser, and — the one that hurt — a `// TODO: route through
 * availability-policy.js` COMMENT, which made the file read as compliant.
 *
 * So this is an AST analysis, not a text scan. It parses each module with
 * `@ast-grep/napi` (already a runtime dependency) and asks structural
 * questions:
 *
 *   * does the module IMPORT the policy — an `import_statement` node, so a
 *     comment or a dead string can never answer yes;
 *   * does a unit run a VERSION PROBE — a spawn-shaped call plus a version flag
 *     reachable from that unit, including one hoisted into a const;
 *   * does it MEMOIZE the verdict — a write to state that OUTLIVES the call
 *     (class field, module-level binding, factory closure, session fact), which
 *     is what makes a bad verdict stick.
 *
 * ## Units, not files
 *
 * Granularity is per top-level declaration ("unit"), not per file. The
 * file-level version of this gate cleared `runner-helpers.ts` and
 * `govulncheck-client.ts` because each already imported the policy for a
 * DIFFERENT memo — 2 of the 7 sites this change migrates hid behind their own
 * neighbours. A unit is one top-level class or function, so a second
 * hand-rolled latch beside a compliant one is its own unit and is judged on its
 * own.
 *
 * ## What it still cannot prove
 *
 * Names carry part of the load: a memo is recognised by an availability-ish
 * identifier holding boolean-ish state. A latch named `q7` with a probe spliced
 * in from another module is out of reach without full type resolution. The
 * vocabulary is deliberately wide (see `MEMO_NAME`), and every widening is
 * pinned by an evasion fixture in the gate's test.
 *
 * ROUTING INHERITANCE — whether a unit that does not spawn its own probe may
 * borrow the routing of the callee it delegates the spawn to — used to be a
 * BLACKLIST: inherit unless the unit's own memo "looks boolean". A #1529 review
 * (#1552) broke that with a memo that is neither boolean nor a policy handle
 * (`Map<string, "yes" | "no">`) and with a genuine boolean reached through a
 * type alias no factory name ever touches — neither spells "boolean", so both
 * inherited routing they never earned. It is now a WHITELIST
 * (`isPolicyHandleMemoShape`): inherit only when the unit's own memo is
 * traceably a `POLICY_FACTORY`'s handle, directly or one hop through a
 * module-local wrapper (`Map<string, ReturnType<typeof makeEslintProbe>>`).
 * An unrecognised shape now defaults to NOT inheriting, which is the safe
 * default a blacklist can never offer — it must relearn every disguise.
 *
 * The whitelist has its own known blind spots:
 *
 *   * a wrapper reached through TWO hops of module-local helpers (unit A calls
 *     helper B, which calls helper C, which calls the factory) is invisible —
 *     `policyHandles` is built from each unit's own direct `policyCalls`, not
 *     propagated transitively, so only a one-hop wrapper like `makeEslintProbe`
 *     is recognised. This narrows what a unit may inherit routing from, so it
 *     is a false NEGATIVE (an actually-routed unit reads as unrouted) — the
 *     safer failure direction, and the one the whitelist was built for;
 *   * a `POLICY_FACTORY` imported under a renamed binding
 *     (`import { createCwdCachedProbe as ccp }`) does not match the factory's
 *     canonical name and reads as a hand-rolled latch, not a handle. Also a
 *     false negative, and not new here — the boolean-shape blacklist this
 *     replaced had the same gap, since neither version resolves import
 *     aliases;
 *   * the whitelist reads a memo's DECLARED shape (`typeText`/`valueText`)
 *     only — never a write's own inlined expression, and never a session fact
 *     (`setSessionFact` records a value, it does not call a factory). A round
 *     of review (#1552 round 2) found both omissions matter: reading a
 *     write's text let an inlined wrapper call
 *     (`cache.set(cwd, await makeToolProbe(cwd))`) leak the wrapper's name
 *     into a plain `Map<string, boolean>` latch's shape, and an unguarded
 *     session-fact check returned non-null unconditionally, so either read as
 *     a policy handle and inherited routing it never earned — the false
 *     POSITIVE the whitelist exists to rule out. Both are fixed; the
 *     `EVASIONS` fixtures below pin them;
 *   * (#1566) the same "reads only the declared shape" rule from the point
 *     above had its own gap: the shape check was a bare `\bname\b` substring
 *     test, so a declared type or value that merely MENTIONED a handle's
 *     name — anywhere in the text — passed, whether or not the memo actually
 *     held that handle. `Map<string, Awaited<ReturnType<ReturnType<typeof
 *     makeToolProbe>>>>` unwraps the wrapper's own return type twice and
 *     peels the promise, landing on a plain `boolean`; `emptyCache<boolean>
 *     (makeToolProbe)` merely hands the wrapper to an unrelated helper as an
 *     argument. Both spell the handle's name and neither holds it. The check
 *     is now shape-anchored: a handle counts only when its name is the
 *     memo's own un-nested `ReturnType<typeof name>` (what a legitimate
 *     one-hop wrapper like `makeEslintProbe` still spells exactly) or the
 *     memo's own direct `= name(...)` call — never a name merely present
 *     somewhere in the text. This closes the two fixtures below without
 *     narrowing the one-hop wrapper case #1552 was built for; the residual
 *     blind spots two points above (transitive wrapper hops, renamed policy
 *     imports) are unchanged and still tracked there.
