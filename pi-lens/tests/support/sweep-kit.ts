/**
 * Shared machinery for this repo's registered-or-fail sweeps — #1755.
 *
 * Seven sweeps now guard pi-lens (session-state conformance, the
 * finding-delivery registry #1692, the host-event shape scan #1706, the
 * hardcoded-machine-paths guard #1735, the ast-grep self-scan #1729, the
 * changelog guard, and the charter/telemetry sweeps #1741/#1743). Each one
 * hand-rolled the same four pieces, and each one re-learned the same lessons
 * in review. This module owns those four pieces once:
 *
 * 1. **Source scanning.** One comment/string stripper ({@link stripSource}),
 *    with the string policy as a caller option — #1692 needs string contents
 *    INTACT because a surface's evidence is often itself a string argument,
 *    while the session-state walk needs them BLANKED so a call named inside a
 *    string is not read as a call.
 * 2. **Registry semantics.** Registered-or-fail, exemptions that require a
 *    reason, and stale-entry self-detection ({@link auditRegistry}).
 * 3. **Tag and evidence binding.** One seam per tag, call-shaped needles, and
 *    nearest-exclusive assignment with a declared claim capacity — #1692's
 *    final algorithm, lifted rather than re-derived
 *    ({@link scanTaggedSeams}, {@link assignNearestExclusive},
 *    {@link checkSeamEvidence}).
 * 4. **The emptiness guard.** A sweep that scans zero files or matches zero
 *    registry entries FAILS ({@link assertNonEmptyScan}). AGENTS.md defect
 *    shape 10, the #1718 lesson: a dead sweep must never read as clean.
 *
 * ## The attack catalogue this kit inherits
 *
 * #1692 paid four review rounds for these. A sweep built on this kit gets the
 * defenses for free; a sweep that re-implements the machinery pays again.
 * `tests/support/sweep-kit.test.ts` carries one NAMED fixture per attack, so
 * a future sweep author reads the threat model out of the tests.
 *
 * - **Comment/string laundering** (#1635 R1, #1692 F1). A call or declaration
 *    named only in a comment or a string is not one. Defense: strip before
 *    you scan, and pick the string policy deliberately.
 * - **Keyword-position regex** (#1635 R2). `typeof /resetX()/` mis-lexes as
 *    division under a preceding-CHARACTER check, leaving the regex body
 *    unstripped and a phantom call visible. Defense: decide regex position
 *    from the preceding TOKEN.
 * - **Proximity laundering** (#1692 R1a). A new untagged seam pasted right
 *    after a tagged one inherits its tag under any lookback window. Defense:
 *    bind to exactly the immediately-preceding non-blank line, and let each
 *    tag line bind at most one seam ({@link bindTagsToSeams}).
 * - **Valid-tag laundering** (#1692 R1b). A rogue seam wearing a REAL id
 *    passes a whole-file evidence search, because that id's evidence lives
 *    somewhere else. Defense: bound the evidence search to the seam's own
 *    region.
 * - **Region overlap / close-range laundering** (#1692 R1c). A rogue seam
 *    placed inside the real seam's window shares the one real occurrence, and
 *    a per-region check clears both. Defense: nearest-EXCLUSIVE assignment
 *    with a declared claim capacity ({@link assignNearestExclusive}).
 * - **Identity-stub laundering** (#1692 R2). Keep the evidence ARGUMENT
 *    (`store: "gitleaks"`) and swap the callee for an identity stub. Defense:
 *    require a call-shaped occurrence of a declared callee within a tight
 *    window of the claimed occurrence.
 * - **Stale allowlist** (#1735). An allowlist entry whose file no longer
 *    matches the sweep is dead weight that reads as a screen. Defense:
 *    {@link auditRegistry} reports it ({@link RegistryAudit.staleExemptions}).
 * - **Dead scan** (#1718, #1729). Zero files scanned, or zero rules resolved,
 *    reports as a clean run. Defense: {@link assertNonEmptyScan}, and
 *    {@link auditRegistry}'s two SEPARATE floors — `minScanned` for "the walk
 *    found nothing to look at" and `minFlagged` for "the walk was healthy but
 *    the detector matched nothing". Same symptom, two causes, two fixes, so
 *    they never share a message (#1755 review F4).
 * - **Prototype-chain exemption** (#1755 review F1). An item named `toString`,
 *    `constructor`, `valueOf` or `__proto__` satisfies `item in exemptions`
 *    against a map that never mentions it, and the stale-exemption check reads
 *    own keys only, so it cannot report the phantom. Defense: `Object.hasOwn`.
 * - **Misplaced tag** (#1755 review F2/F3). A tag far above its seam across a
 *    run of blank lines, or written inline at the end of a seam line where it
 *    silently tags the NEXT seam instead. Defense: a bounded blank-line gap
 *    (`maxBlankGap`, default 1) and outright rejection of inline tags — see
 *    {@link bindTagsToSeams}.
 *
 * ## Known limits, named rather than papered over
 *
 * - {@link listSourceFiles}'s `exclude` filters FILES only. It never prunes a
 *   directory walk, so excluding `vendor/x.ts` still descends into `vendor/`.
 *   That is cheap on these trees; a sweep over a `node_modules`-sized tree
 *   needs directory pruning this kit does not offer (#1755 review F5).
 * - Under `strings: "blank"`, a call written inside a TEMPLATE EXPRESSION
 *   (`` `${resetThing()}` ``) is blanked with the rest of the template, so a
 *   reachability walk cannot see it. This matches the behavior the
 *   session-state sweep shipped with before the kit, and it is a false
 *   NEGATIVE — the direction that matters for a guard. No such call exists in
 *   `clients/` today. A sweep that needs them visible wants `strings: "keep"`
 *   and a needle-based check (#1755 review F6).
 *
 * This module is deliberately STATELESS — no module-level caches, no latches.
 * A sweep helper that memoized its own scan would be exactly the
 * process-lifetime-state shape the session-state sweep exists to catch.

 * A `/` opens a regex only where a VALUE may start, decided from the preceding

/**
 * A per-file stateful-SYMBOL-COUNT pin, layered on {@link auditRegistry}'s

 *
 * The session-state sweep's file-level coverage audit ({@link auditRegistry}
 * called directly on file paths) answers "is this FILE registered or
 * exempted" — it cannot see that a NEW stateful symbol landed inside a file
 * that already answered yes. That is exactly how #1801 review F1 shipped:
 * `tree-sitter-client.ts`'s `staleGrammarVersionAt` memo sat invisible inside
 * an already-registered module while the sweep stayed 55/55 green.
 *
 * The fix folds each file's LIVE detected-symbol count into its registry id
 * (`file@N`) and re-uses {@link auditRegistry} unchanged: a file whose count
 * changed presents a DIFFERENT id than the one pinned, and an id the pin does
 * not name is, to `auditRegistry`, an ordinary unaccounted item. No new
 * registry, no new exemption semantics — the same machinery, one extra
 * dimension folded into the id.
 *
 * This is coarser than full symbol-to-reset attribution (option (a) in
 * #1817): it says a file's total changed, not which symbol changed or
 * whether the new one needs a reset. That is the deliberate trade — cheap
 * enough to pin all ~72 currently-flagged files in one table, and it still
 * makes the #1801 shape structurally impossible to add silently, because the
 * pin can only ever fail LOUD (an unmatched id), never pass on a symbol it
 * never saw.
