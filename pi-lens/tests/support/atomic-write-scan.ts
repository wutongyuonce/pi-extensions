/**
 * Mechanical scan for direct-to-final-path filesystem writes under `clients/`
 * that bypass the shared atomic tmp+rename seam (#762's `clients/atomic-write.ts`,
 * #1609 layer a).
 *
 * A process that gets SIGKILLed mid-write (the Node auto-upgrade
 * RestartManager kill from the pi-free crash forensics, or any other hard
 * kill) can leave a torn file behind at whatever path it was writing to. A
 * raw `fs.writeFile`/`fs.writeFileSync` straight at the final path has no
 * protection against this: a reader can observe the file mid-write. The
 * shared `writeFileAtomic`/`writeFileAtomicAsync` helpers (and the
 * `commitDurableStore`/`commitDurableStoreAsync` locked read-modify-write
 * seam built on them) stage into a per-call tmp file and `rename()` over the
 * target, so a reader only ever observes the fully-old or fully-new file.
 *
 * This scan DERIVES the write-site inventory from the source at test-run
 * time — it does not hand-maintain a parallel list of "files that write
 * state" (the single-source-of-truth rule). What IS hand-maintained is the
 * EXEMPTION list below, because "is this write persisted state that must
 * survive a crash, or a same-call scratch file / append-only log / different
 * atomicity discipline (O_EXCL lock creation)" is a semantic judgment a
 * static scan cannot make reliably — exactly `AGENTS.md` shape 7's
 * "syntactically identical, semantically different" trap. Every exemption
 * below carries a REASON; `tests/clients/atomic-write-sweep.test.ts` is
 * expected to review it, not just import it.
