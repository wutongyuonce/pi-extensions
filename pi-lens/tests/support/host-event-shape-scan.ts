/**
 * Mechanical scan for `session_start` / `tool_call` / `tool_result` /
 * `agent_end` / `agent_settled` test fixtures that put fields on the EVENT
 * object the real pi host never puts there — #1681.
 *
 * Ground truth is the host source (earendil-works/pi), not this repo's own
 * assumptions. Each of the five events pi-lens registers a handler for
 * (`index.ts`'s `EXPECTED_HOOKS`), by its full field list in
 * `packages/coding-agent/src/core/extensions/types.ts`:
 *
 * - `SessionStartEvent` (561-568): `type`, `reason`, `previousSessionFile`.
 *   Every construction site (`agent-session.ts:393,2725`,
 *   `agent-session-runtime.ts:218,251,305,328,347,391`) builds only those.
 * - `ToolCallEventBase` (869-872) plus its per-tool variants: `type`,
 *   `toolCallId`, `toolName`, `input`.
 * - `ToolResultEventBase` (930-939): `type`, `toolCallId`, `input`, `content`,
 *   `isError`, `usage?`, plus a per-tool `details`/`toolName`. The one
 *   construction site (`agent-session.ts:503-516`) builds only those — also
 *   pinned against the host's own compiled build by
 *   `tests/clients/pi-host-contract.test.ts`'s `HOST_TOOL_RESULT_KEYS`.
 * - `AgentEndEvent` (733-736): `type`, `messages`.
 * - `AgentSettledEvent` (739-741): `type` only.
 *
 * None of the five carries `sessionId`, `provider`, or `model` — a handler
 * that wants any of those reads them off `ctx`
 * (`ctx.sessionManager.getSessionId()`, `ctx.model`), never off the event.
 * `tests/support/pi-mock.ts`'s `makeCtx` already encodes this correctly; this
 * scan is what stops a fixture from drifting back to putting them on the
 * event instead (the #1681 index-wiring instance:
 * `{ sessionId: "wiring-session" }` as the SECOND arg to
 * `pi.emit("session_start", ...)`).
 *
 * Unlike `session-state-scan.ts`'s registry, this needs no hand-maintained
 * exemption list: there is no legitimate reason for any of these five
 * fixtures to carry any of these three fields, so any hit is a violation. A
 * suite that genuinely needs an off-contract shape to test defensive
 * handling should construct it by hand with a comment saying so, not through
 * `.emit(...)` with one of these five event-type strings.
