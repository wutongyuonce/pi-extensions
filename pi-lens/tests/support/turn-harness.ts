/**
 * Deterministic turn-simulation harness — #1635 item 1.
 *
 * The bug family this exists for is multi-turn state evolution: a scan runs at
 * turn 1, the agent edits at turn 2, and turn 3 replays a verdict that is no
 * longer true. Every 2026-08-18 staleness incident (#1622 gitleaks, #1630 knip,
 * #1631 dependency drift, the advisory-provenance file-set blind spot) has that
 * shape, and none of them is expressible as a single-shot unit test: the defect
 * only exists in the RELATIONSHIP between turn N's cache and turn N+1's render.
 *
 * So the harness scripts turns, not calls. A scenario writes files, records
 * scans, ends a turn, edits again, ends another turn — and asserts on what the
 * AGENT SEES at each turn end: the composed turn-end message, split into its
 * real tiers (blocker / action-needed / advisory).
 *
 * ## What is deterministic here, and what is not
 *
 * - **Clock.** {@link ScenarioClock} is a LOGICAL clock, not a global `Date`
 *   replacement. Every timestamp the staleness logic actually compares — a
 *   file's mtime and a scan's `scannedAt` — is stamped from it, so a scenario
 *   controls the whole "was this file touched after the scan" relation exactly.
 *   `Date.now()` inside `handleTurnEnd` is deliberately left alone: it feeds
 *   duration telemetry only, and monkey-patching it would fight vitest's own
 *   timer handling for no assertion gain. Nothing in this harness asserts on a
 *   duration.
 * - **Filesystem.** A real temp dir, not an in-memory fake. The code under
 *   test calls `fs.statSync`/`fs.readFileSync` on cited paths directly (see
 *   `advisory-provenance.ts`), so a fake FS would have to intercept node:fs
 *   globally — more fragile, and it would stop exercising the real mtime
 *   comparison that every one of these bugs turns on. Determinism comes from
 *   `utimesSync` with clock-derived times, not from replacing the FS.
 * - **Scanners.** Never spawned. A scenario states a scanner's RESULT
 *   (`h.scan(...)`, `h.knip(...)`); the harness feeds it through the same
 *   cache/dep seams `handleTurnEnd` reads in production.
 *
 * ## Writing a scenario
 *
 * A scenario is metadata plus a short async body — roughly ten lines:
 *
 * ```ts
 * defineTurnScenario({
 *   id: "gitleaks-stale-replay",
 *   incident: "2026-08-18 — gitleaks kept citing a line the agent had edited",
 *   issue: "#1622",
 *   async run(h) {
 *     const file = h.write("src/config.ts", "const k = 'AKIA…';");
 *     h.scan("gitleaks", { findings: [{ ruleId: "aws-access-token", file, startLine: 397 }] });
 *     h.advance(5_000);
 *     h.edit("src/config.ts", "const k = process.env.KEY;");
 *     const view = await h.turnEnd();
 *     expect(view.blockers).toEqual([]);
 *     expect(view.text).toContain("src/config.ts");
 *   },
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * `pendingOn` marks a scenario whose fix is not on master yet. It is SKIPPED,
 * never softened into an assertion of the buggy behavior — see
 * {@link TurnScenario.pendingOn}.

 * Scenarios therefore read as a story ("scan, then five seconds later the agent
 * edits") while producing the same RELATIVE ordering on every run.
 *
 * It starts at `Date.now()`, not at a fixed epoch. Review round R1 (S2) caught
 * why that matters: the production code the harness drives stamps some of its
 * own records with the real `Date.now()` — `recordInlineBlockers`' capture
 * time, which #1633's gate compares file mtimes against. With the clock pinned
 * to a fixed 2026-08-18 epoch, every scenario file was written a day or more
 * BEFORE those records, so the era gap between the two clocks decided the
 * comparison instead of the scenario's own `advance()` calls. Anchoring at
 * construction puts both on one timeline; determinism then comes from the
 * relative offsets a scenario asks for, which is the only thing any of these
