/**
 * Registered-or-fail sweep for bounded telemetry (#1743).
 *
 * The rule this makes structural: a record written on a FAILURE path either
 * routes through `emitBounded`/`admitBounded`, or it names the reason its
 * volume is already bounded. Prose could not enforce that — four PRs in two
 * days each rebuilt the bounding by hand, and each needed a review round to
 * get it right.
 *
 * Shape follows the #1692 lessons the finding-delivery-gate sweep paid for:
 *
 * - **Call-shaped evidence.** Findings come from balanced-paren CALL sites, so
 *   a failure names a file, a line, and a callee a reader can go open.
 * - **One seam per tag.** A phase belongs to the registry or to the reasons
 *   map, never both, and the sweep asserts the exclusivity in both directions.
 * - **No stale claims.** Every reasons-map key and every registry entry must
 *   still correspond to a live call site, so a deleted or migrated phase turns
 *   the declaration red instead of leaving a lie behind.
