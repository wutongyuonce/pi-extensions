/**
 * Tests for clients/gzip-stage-write.ts — the shared worker-thread body-persist
 * core (#958) used by both the review-graph and project-snapshot persist
 * workers.
 *
 * #1217: this module hand-rolled `${stagePath}.tmp-${process.pid}` instead of
 * sourcing its staging name from `atomic-write.ts`, so it never inherited the
 * #1205 per-call fix. Its callers pass a per-generation `stagePath`, which
 * makes two calls on one path rare — but pid isolates nothing between worker
 * threads (they share `process.pid`), so a retry, a re-queued persist, a
 * repeated generation, or a future non-generational caller collides exactly.
 * Its docstring also asserted crash-safety in language that read as
 * concurrency-safety, the same false-confidence pattern #1205 found in
 * `atomic-write.ts`'s own docstring.
 *
 * Nothing here branches on `process.platform` (recurring defect shape 2/7).

 * its body and `gunzipSync` threw (or, worse, silently returned truncated
