/**
 * #1618: `handleTurnEnd` (clients/runtime-turn.ts) arms a detached 240s
 * `scheduleLSPIdleReset` on any file-less turn. Nothing previously stopped
 * that timer from firing WHILE a `lens_diagnostics mode=full` sweep
 * (`LSPService.runWorkspaceDiagnostics`) was still in flight — the timer
 * called `resetLSPService`, which tears down the very service the sweep was
 * touching, and every file the sweep had not yet reached failed with a bare
 * `timedOut: true` indistinguishable from a real budget timeout.
 *
 * This drives a real `runWorkspaceDiagnostics` sweep over five files and
 * calls the real `resetLSPService({ reason: "idle" })` mid-sweep (from
 * inside the third file's `waitForDiagnostics` resolution — the same shape
 * as the detached timer firing while `touchFile` is in flight). The files
 * the sweep had not yet reached must come back with the discriminated
 * `unconfirmedReason: "service_destroyed"` — never a bare `timedOut` that
 * reads identically to a budget timeout.
