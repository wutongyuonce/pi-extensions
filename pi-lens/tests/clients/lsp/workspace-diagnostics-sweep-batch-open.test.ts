/**
 * #608: a full-workspace sweep (`runWorkspaceDiagnostics`) over files that
 * aren't already open in the client's document set used to defeat #271's
 * `WatchedFilesQueue` debounce batching. `WatchedFilesQueue.enqueue` only arms
 * its flush timer on the FIRST call and just accumulates on every call after
 * that until the 100ms debounce window elapses (see watch-queue.ts) — a
 * mechanism built so a burst of file-opens coalesces into ONE project-wide
 * recheck notification instead of N.
 *
 * The sweep's per-file loop processes files SERIALLY, waiting up to several
 * seconds for each file's own diagnostics before moving to the next one. The
 * gap between consecutive first-opens during a sweep is always far longer
 * than the 100ms window, so the debounce never actually coalesced anything —
 * every previously-unopened file fired its own individual watched-files
 * notification, each independently triggering a project-wide recheck on a
 * single-threaded push-diagnostics server (classic tsserver). Later files
 * then timed out purely from queueing behind those rechecks.
 *
 * The fix pre-opens every swept file's document (in one fast, un-gated pass,
 * per server group) BEFORE the diagnostics-wait loop starts, so all the
 * watched-files enqueue calls land inside the SAME 100ms debounce window and
 * coalesce into one flush — restoring #271's "once per burst" intent for a
 * full sweep, not just per-edit dispatch bursts.
 *
 * #621 follow-up: the pre-open pass is now CHUNKED (default width 8, see
 * `WORKSPACE_SWEEP_PREOPEN_CHUNK_SIZE` and
 * workspace-diagnostics-sweep-preopen-chunk.test.ts) instead of firing the
 * WHOLE group's opens in one uninterrupted burst — a whole-group burst at
 * real project scale (~150 files) was found to overwhelm a single-threaded
 * server's request queue before any per-file diagnostics request got a turn.
 * This test's 12 files span 2 chunks (8+4), so it now expects 2 flushes
 * (one per chunk) instead of 1 (one for the whole group) — still far short of
 * 12 (one per file, the original #608 bug this test guards against).
 *
 * This test fakes the client's `notify.open` to reproduce the real
 * `WatchedFilesQueue` coalescing behavior (imported from source, not
 * reimplemented) plus a deliberately SLOW `waitForDiagnostics` (150ms, well
 * past the 100ms debounce) standing in for tsserver's real per-file
 * recompute latency — the exact condition that used to spread first-opens
 * past the debounce window one file at a time. If the pre-open batching
 * regressed back to "open lazily inside the per-file touch", this slow wait
 * would cause N flushes instead of one-per-chunk.
