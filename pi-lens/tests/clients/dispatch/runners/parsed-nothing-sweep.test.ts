/**
 * Registered-or-fail sweep for the #1948 parsed-nothing gate.
 *
 * `parseToolRun` composes BOTH gates a runner needs before it may claim a
 * clean file: "the tool produced nothing" (#1816) and "the tool produced
 * something the parser could not read" (#1948). A runner that reaches for an
 * OLDER spawn-outcome primitive gets only the first, which is exactly the
 * state that hid five parser bugs for months.
 *
 * The first round of this sweep watched `skipUnlessToolRan` alone. That was
 * too narrow, and a review probe proved it: six runners consult the spawn
 * outcome through `spawnFailedWithNoOutput` or `classifyRunOutcome` instead,
 * so they passed this sweep while carrying the live #1948 hole (tflint and
 * detekt actually did). LEGACY_GATES below names all three primitives, so a
 * runner cannot opt out by picking a different one.
 *
 * Two registries, no overlap. This file owns runners that ARE on a
 * spawn-outcome primitive but not on `parseToolRun`. `run-outcome-ratchet`'s
 * `NOT_YET_ON_PRIMITIVE` owns runners that are on no primitive at all. The
 * last test asserts the exclusivity, so a runner cannot be declared twice or
 * fall between them.
 *
 * Stale claims fail too — an exemption whose call site is gone turns red
 * instead of leaving a lie behind.
