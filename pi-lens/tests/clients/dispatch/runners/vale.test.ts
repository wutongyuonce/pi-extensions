/**
 * #1933 review F1: `parseValeOutput` used to assume a
 * `{ Data: { Files: [...] } }` envelope. No real `vale` binary has ever
 * emitted that shape (AGENTS.md defect shape 16 -- an unverified claim
 * about a tool's output, never checked against a real run). A real
 * `vale --output JSON` v3.9.6 run instead emits a flat map keyed by the
 * linted file's path, each value an array of alert objects with no
 * separate "Column" field (the column lives in `Span[0]`).
 *
 * Fixtures below are captured verbatim from real `vale --output JSON`
 * v3.9.6 runs (Windows binary, pinned release, sha256-verified against
 * this PR's .github/workflows/lint.yml pin) against this repo's own
 * AGENTS.md (warning/suggestion severities) and a scratch two-em-dash
 * sample linted with Google.EmDash enabled (error severity) -- not
 * hand-written. Trimmed to a few representative alerts; every field is
 * real.
 *
 * Pre-fix, `parsed?.Data?.Files` was always undefined against this real
 * shape, so `parseValeOutput` silently returned zero diagnostics no
 * matter how many real findings -- including error-severity ones -- the
 * binary actually reported. Imports the REAL `parseValeOutput` from the
 * compiled runner, not a private copy, so this can't silently drift from
 * the shipped parser (the #1791 biome-check.test.ts precedent).
