/**
 * Test the playground-verifier pipeline end-to-end. The verifier spins up
 * a headless Chrome, navigates to https://ast-grep.github.io/playground.html
 * with the rule YAML and the caller's source encoded in the URL hash, then
 * scrapes the "Found N match(es)" / "No match found" text. This test asserts
 * the pipeline runs without error, actually evaluates the caller's `--code`
 * (not a fallback sample), and produces a non-error result for a known-good
 * rule.
 *
 * #2208: the verifier used to write the caller's code into the playground's
 * `query` field, which only feeds its separate "Pattern" mode. In "Config"
 * mode (what this verifier always uses) the engine matches against
 * `state.source` instead, so the hash carried no `source` at all and the
 * playground's state merge silently fell back to its own hardcoded sample.
 * Every run graded the rule against that fixed sample — `--code` was inert —
 * so `matches` was 0 (or whatever the sample produced) regardless of what
 * was actually passed in. "smoke: loads the playground and reports a
 * known-good rule's match count against the caller's code" below is the
 * fix's regression test: a rule + a snippet it demonstrably matches, which
 * reported 0 before the fix (`source` now carries `--code`).
 *
 * Skipped when:
 *   - Google Chrome is not on PATH (and PILENS_PLAYGROUND_CHROME is unset)
 *   - the playground URL can't be reached (offline / firewalled CI)
 *
 * Slow path (~15s per rule): the playground is a Docusaurus + VitePress SPA
 * with heavy JS bundles; first-load is the dominant cost. Don't enable this
 * in the default `npm test` run; it's opt-in for local dev / nightly.
