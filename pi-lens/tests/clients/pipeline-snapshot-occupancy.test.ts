/**
 * Event-loop occupancy guard for the tool_result autofix side-effect walk
 * (#361/#368, follow-up to #192). `snapshotProjectFiles` runs on the
 * `tool_result` pipeline path — after a formatter/fixer touches a file, pi-lens
 * snapshots the tree (before/after) to detect side-effect changes. It walks up
 * to `AUTOFIX_CHANGED_FILE_SCAN_LIMIT` files and **chunk-yields** every
 * `SNAPSHOT_YIELD_EVERY` (#368), so even at the cap it must not hold the loop
 * (and the TUI) for more than a short stretch.
 *
 * We measure occupancy (longest sync block), NOT wall-clock duration. At the
 * ~5k-file cap this asserts the walk yields: a chunk is ~tens of ms while the
 * pre-#368 non-yielding walk was ~130ms+ (2-4x under CI load). The guard trips
 * if the walk stops yielding, or if a regression explodes its cost:
 *   - directory excludes break and the walk descends `node_modules`/ignored
 *     dirs (the walk-confinement invariant), exploding the file count;
 *   - the scan cap is removed/raised so the walk no longer self-limits;
 *   - a per-file synchronous cost is added (e.g. a `readFileSync` per entry).
