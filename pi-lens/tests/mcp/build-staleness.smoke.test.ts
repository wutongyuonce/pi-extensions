/**
 * Warm build-staleness guard (#535) — real end-to-end smoke: spawns the actual
 * server subprocess, then bumps an isolated "entry" file's mtime (simulating a
 * rebuild that lands while the server keeps running with its OLD in-memory
 * code), and asserts the next `tools/call` visibly flags it — either via
 * `pilens_analyze` force-routing to `mode=fresh` (`servedBy` marker) or via
 * the honest-degrade `warmCodeStale: true` warning on a warm-only tool
 * (`pilens_health`/`pilens_latency`).
 *
 * The server's staleness stamp is pointed at a dedicated temp file via
 * `PI_LENS_MCP_STALENESS_STAT_PATH` rather than the real `mcp/server.js` —
 * bumping the REAL file's mtime would leak into every OTHER concurrently-
 * spawned server process in the same parallel vitest run (they all stat the
 * same shared file), which is exactly what happened the first time this test
 * was written: it made `server.smoke.test.ts`'s unrelated warm-mode assertion
 * flip to `[fresh]` under `npm test`'s full parallel suite despite passing in
 * isolation.
 *
 * Requires `npm run build` first (resolves mcp/server.js next to its source).
