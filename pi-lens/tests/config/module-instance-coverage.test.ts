/**
 * #1565 — tests must import the artifact the runtime imports.
 *
 * Vitest resolves `x.ts` and `x.js` to two separate module instances, and this
 * repo's runtime is the compiled `.js`. A test that spells a build-compiled
 * module `.ts` therefore holds a private copy of that module's mutable state:
 * a reset called through it clears the copy, the code under test keeps reading
 * the compiled original, and the assertion passes vacuously (defect shape 7).
 *
 * See tests/support/module-instance-scan.ts for the mechanics, and
 * module-instance-binding.test.ts for the live demonstration that a
 * `.ts`-bound reset does not clear compiled state.
