/**
 * Tier-aware cascade-lane wait policy (#458, re-scope №2).
 *
 * The cascade/deferred lane (`computeCascadeForFile`'s neighbor-touch fan-out
 * in `clients/dispatch/integration.ts`) actively opens neighbor files against
 * their LSP client and waits up to a per-touch budget (~1000ms cold-snapshot /
 * 2000ms warm) for `textDocument/publishDiagnostics` before deciding the
 * neighbor is clean. For a Tier-3 server — one that is `push-only` AND known
 * to publish NOTHING on a clean→clean transition (see
 * docs/lsp-capability-matrix.md; today that's typescript-language-server, the
 * lone core-set instance) — that wait can never distinguish "clean" from
 * "still analyzing"; it always burns its full budget. Dogfooding measured
 * ~221 such `lsp_diagnostics_timeout` events/day.
 *
 * pi 0.80.6's `agent_settled` quiet window (#483, `clients/quiet-window.ts`)
 * gives the cascade lane a place to resolve that ambiguity OUT of the
 * per-touch budget: fire the touch (didOpen/didChange still happens, so the
 * server starts real work), record it as outstanding, and reconcile against
 * whatever landed in the client's diagnostics cache by the time the agent run
 * goes idle. A touch nothing arrived for by then is recorded `unresolved` —
 * never silently treated as `clean` (the #240 doctrine: a missing answer is
 * not an affirmative answer).
 *
 * This module is deliberately NOT hardcoded to server names for the "should
 * this file skip its in-lane wait" question: it reads the live capability
 * snapshot's `workspaceDiagnosticsSupport.mode` (from
 * `detectWorkspaceDiagnosticsSupport`, cached at `initialize`) and combines it
 * with the `silentOnClean` marker on that server's `DiagnosticStrategy`
 * (`wait-policy/strategies.ts`) — the same per-server behavioral-knowledge table
 * the rest of the LSP layer already uses. A server with no live snapshot yet,
 * or whose mode isn't `push-only`, or that isn't marked `silentOnClean`, is
 * NOT tier-3 — the caller keeps today's full in-lane wait. Fail-safe is
 * always "wait like before".
 *
 * Native TS7 is the cascade-only exception. It is not silent on clean, but
 * its publication does not settle inside the cold-snapshot budget. Cascade
 * classifies it as `collect-later`, sends the same no-wait touch, and
 * reconciles its later per-file push or pull publication. The shared server
 * policy remains `waits`, so main-lane behavior does not change.
 *
 * #524/#529/#541/#558: a server id can now be backed by more than one actual
 * binary — "typescript" is classic typescript-language-server OR TS7's
 * native `tsc --lsp --stdio` (PR #526). PR #526 originally routed the
 * native-ts7 variant through the fail-safe "waits" path because
 * `silentOnClean` had only been measured against the classic server; #541
 * (2026-07-11) briefly lifted that exclusion after a clean-signal probe run
 * appeared to show native-ts7 silent too. A follow-up dual-environment
 * re-measurement (2026-07-12, nightly CI on Linux AND a live local run on
 * Windows dev, same `typescript@7.0.2` both times) found native-ts7 now
 * publishes 2 version-less diagnostic sets on the clean transition
 * (`cleanPubs=2(v:0)`) — it is NOT silent. Classic is unaffected and
 * confirmed still silent (`cleanPubs=0(v:0)`) in the same run. This is
 * therefore an EVIDENCE-BASED revert, not the original unverified caution:
 * native-ts7's clean-signal behavior IS known, and it is "publishes, not
 * silent". The shared classifier still routes a native-ts7 snapshot through
 * `waits`. The cascade-only wrapper routes it through `collect-later` because
 * the measured publication arrives after the in-lane budget. The shared
 * `silentOnClean` flag stays `true` for classic.
 * `scripts/probe-clean-signal.mjs`'s drift check no
 * longer compares native-ts7 rows against the shared marker (it now expects
 * `false` for them explicitly) — see that file's header for the regression
 * watch this sets up for a future TS7 build that becomes silent again.
