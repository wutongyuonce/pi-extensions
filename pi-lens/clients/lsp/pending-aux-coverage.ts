/**
 * #2001/#2002 — collect-later coverage store for slow auxiliary LSP servers.
 *
 * When a `with-auxiliary` touch's aux-grace window expires without a
 * publication from an auxiliary scanner (opengrep on Windows measures ~8s per
 * scan against a 2s grace), that scanner's eventual findings were silently
 * cached inside its LSP client and never surfaced to the agent: the auxiliary
 * contributed ZERO agent-visible coverage on most edits.
 *
 * This module is the bounded hand-off between the two halves of the fix:
 *
 *   - PRODUCER (`clients/lsp/index.ts`'s aux-grace wait): after the outcomes
 *     are decided, every auxiliary with no publication evidence for this
 *     content (`cut_off` or `silent`, minus #1493's published-this-content
 *     exemption) marks its (filePath, serverId) pair here. DEFERRED servers
 *     are never marked — they never received the content, so their cache
 *     still describes the PREVIOUS revision (#1459).
 *   - CONSUMER (`clients/runtime-turn.ts` at turn_end): drains the store,
 *     probes each pair through the read-only
 *     `LSPService.readCachedDiagnosticsForServers` seam, freshness-gates the
 *     result against `markedAtMs`, and delivers survivors as the registered
 *     `runtime-turn:late-auxiliary-findings` gated surface. A pair whose
 *     client is alive but has STILL published nothing is re-armed until
 *     readLateAuxRearmTtlMs() (env-overridable via
 *     `PI_LENS_LATE_AUX_REARM_TTL_MS`) after the LAST re-arm, so a scan
 *     finishing between two turn ends is not lost and a demonstrably alive
 *     but slow scanner keeps its window open; `markedAtMs` itself never
 *     moves — it stays the immutable freshness baseline the delivery gate
 *     stats against. Past the TTL, or when the client is gone, the entry is
 *     dropped silently (best-effort by design).
 *
 * Bounds: at most MAX_PENDING_ENTRIES (file, server) pairs, insertion-order
 * eviction of the OLDEST pair when the cap is exceeded (shape 9 discipline —
 * the axis that grows is the pair count, so that is the axis that is capped).
 * Keys fold through `normalizeEphemeralMapKey`: this is a hot single-process
 * index whose keys are produced by this same process's touch path, so the
 * cheap ephemeral normalizer is the lifetime-appropriate choice per the
 * PathKeyedMap guidance — no realpath walk on the per-edit path.
 *
 * #2324 F3/R2-A: this module ALSO hands off in the other direction, for
 * ast-grep specifically. Gate B's napi runner is a second producer of
 * coverage for the same (file, "ast-grep") pair — when it runs as the
 * fallback and actually evaluates rules, it calls
 * {@link recordNapiFallbackCoverage}. The PRODUCER above reads that record
 * (via {@link napiFallbackCoveredSince}) before deciding whether to mark a
 * pair, because napi's Gate-B check settles synchronously while the aux-grace
 * wait's own decision takes up to its full grace budget — by the time the
 * wait is ready to mark, THIS touch's napi run (if any) has already finished,
 * so the wait can reliably see it; a clear issued from napi's side cannot,
 * because the mark it would be racing has not been written yet.
 * {@link clearPendingAuxiliaryCoverage} is still used, but only to drop a
 * LEFTOVER pair from an EARLIER touch once napi has fresh evaluated findings
 * to supersede it.
