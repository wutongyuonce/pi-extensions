/**
 * LSP `textDocument/didChange` sync-kind negotiation (#1669).
 *
 * A server advertises how it wants document changes described via
 * `ServerCapabilities.textDocumentSync`, either as a bare
 * `TextDocumentSyncKind` number (the legacy pre-3.0 shape) or as a
 * `TextDocumentSyncOptions` object whose `change` field carries the kind.
 * pi-lens always sent a single whole-document `{ text }` change event — valid
 * for `Full` (1) and harmless for `None` (0, since the server ignores content
 * changes entirely), but out of spec for `Incremental` (2): an
 * Incremental-only server expects every change event to carry a `range`.
 *
 * This module is the pure negotiation core, mirroring `position-encoding.ts`'s
 * shape: read the kind from the server's `initialize` reply, defaulting to
 * `Full` when the server doesn't advertise one — the same shape pi-lens has
 * always sent, so an unrecognized/absent value never regresses `Full`/`None`
 * behavior.
