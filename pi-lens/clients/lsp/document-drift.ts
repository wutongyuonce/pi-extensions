/**
 * #1783 — disk-drift backstop for open LSP documents.
 *
 * An edit made outside the tracked write/edit path (a bash-tool bulk edit)
 * never produces a `didChange`, so the language server keeps answering from
 * the content it was last given. Nothing compared disk against that content,
 * so the stale view survived for as long as the server stayed up: proven live
 * on 2026-08-20, where `src/mcp/stdio.ts` published `diagnosticCount:2` for
 * 40 minutes while `tsc` on disk reported 0.
 *
 * This module records what content actually landed on a server and, on a
 * bounded cadence, compares disk against that record.
 *
 * ## The drift key pairs mtime with size (catalog shape 6)
 *
 * Neither half is sufficient on its own:
 *
 * - Size alone misses a same-length edit (a renamed identifier, a flipped
 *   comparison) — the exact shape a bulk sed produces.
 * - An mtime comparison alone misses an edit whose tool preserves the
 *   original timestamp (`cp -p`, an archive extract, a `utimes` restore).
 *
 * The mtime half compares against `syncedAt` — the wall clock at which the
 * content landed on the server — not against a stat taken at record time.
 * That keeps the recording path free of a stat: pi-lens always syncs AFTER
 * the write it is reacting to, so `mtimeMs > syncedAt` means "disk moved
 * after we last told the server anything".
 *
 * A stat divergence is a CANDIDATE, not a verdict. The sweep then reads the
 * file and compares the content fingerprint. A touched-but-unchanged file
 * (`touch`, a formatter that rewrote identical bytes) re-stamps its record
 * and sends nothing. That preserves the changed/unchanged distinction rather
 * than laundering both into one "drifted" verdict.
 *
 * Out of scope, stated plainly: an edit that changes content, keeps the
 * length identical, AND preserves mtime is invisible to `stat`. Detecting it
 * needs a read of every tracked document on every pass, which is the cost
 * this design exists to avoid. The disk-binding contentHash on the read path
 * (`diagnostic-binding.ts`) remains the check for that case.
 *
 * ## The record is per FILE, so it must claim only full coverage
 *
 * A file can be open on several servers at once: the primary language server
 * plus the cross-cutting auxiliary scanners. One record per file therefore
 * means one claim about ALL of them. `LSPService.recordFullyCoveredSync` only
 * stamps when every server that currently holds the document was targeted by
 * the sync AND every one of those writes landed. A primary-only touch while an
 * auxiliary holds the document writes nothing, and neither does a touch where
 * one server's write timed out.
 *
 * The resync is the mirror image: it targets every live client holding the
 * document, so a heal cannot leave one view behind and then stamp the file as
 * current. On a partial sync the OLD record survives, with an older timestamp
 * and an older fingerprint, so the document stays eligible instead of going
 * invisible.
 *
 * ## Cost and pacing
 *
 * One `stat` per tracked document per pass, at most {@link DRIFT_CHECK_BATCH}
 * documents per pass, at most one pass per {@link driftCheckIntervalMs}. A
 * read happens only for a document whose stat already diverged.
 *
 * Resyncs are capped at {@link DRIFT_RESYNC_BATCH} per pass and run serially,
 * so a 200-file bulk edit heals in paced rounds instead of firing 200
 * concurrent `didChange` writes at one single-threaded server — the #1714
 * sweep-burst shape. Each resync goes through the caller's normal touch path,
 * so it inherits the existing per-server notify-write budget and
 * backpressure demotion rather than bypassing them.
