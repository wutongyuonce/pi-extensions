/**
 * Session-scoped cooldown for commands whose spawn TIMED OUT (#1995).
 *
 * Live evidence: one wedged `markdownlint-cli2.cmd` on Windows charged its
 * failure budget three times for a single edit — availability verification
 * (30s, SIGTERM), autofix `--fix` (30s), and the lint runner (15s) each paid
 * separately, because a positive probe/cache verdict said nothing about the
 * command's ability to COMPLETE. Total post-edit cost: 52-60 seconds.
 *
 * This seam is the shared negative evidence:
 * - `noteSpawnTimeout` records that a resolved command timed out, in which
 *   phase, and what wrapper kind it had; every record emits one bounded
 *   latency row so the session stays auditable.
 * - `isInSpawnTimeoutCooldown` is consulted by every invocation path for that
 *   command — verification, autofix, and lint — so ONE wedged executable
 *   consumes at most ONE bounded failure budget per edit (invariant 1) and a
 *   timeout/skipped result is never re-reported as clean (invariant 4).
 *
 * Durability contract: SESSION. A hot loop of edits must not retry (a wedged
 * `.cmd` shim does not heal between edits), but a new session may — the
 * executable or its environment may have changed. Reset is registered in the
 * session-state registry (`spawn-timeout-cooldown:latches`) and wired into
 * `handleSessionStart`.
