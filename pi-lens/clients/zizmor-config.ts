// GitHub-aware online audits (known-vulnerable-actions, unpinned-uses,
// impostor-commit) for the rest of the session while the scan still reported
// success. Only a genuine answer (gh ran and returned a real exit code, or is
// proven absent) latches now; a timeout/stall/unspawnable probe expires on the
// shared cooldown and is re-probed on the next call.
//
// The cooldown ladder is capped below zizmor's respawn cadence, but that

// idle reset is 240s, while a subagent session or budget pressure can
// recycle the fleet on `clients/lsp-budget.ts`'s shorter
// `DEFAULT_LSP_BUDGET_IDLE_TIMEOUT_MS` (60s). The 120s cap sits BELOW the
// 240s cadence but ABOVE the 60s one, so that faster respawn can still land
// inside a still-cooling verdict — the shared default cap
// (`TRANSIENT_MAX_COOLDOWN_MS`, 5 min) would make either respawn read the
// cache instead of re-probing. The 60s gap is covered differently: the
// cache-hit path in `resolveZizmorGitHubToken` logs an
// `availability_decision` and counts a degradation on every transient cache
// read, not only on the probe that produced it, so a respawn landing inside
// EITHER cadence is still observable even when it isn't re-probed (#1535
