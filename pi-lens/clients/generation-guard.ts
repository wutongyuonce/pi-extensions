/**
 * Capture-generation-before-await, check-after — as one primitive (#1754).
 *
 * The shape: a write that follows an `await` must prove the world it captured
 * still exists. A session reset, a cache refresh, or a newer request for the
 * same key can land while the write's producer is in flight, and the late
 * write then publishes an answer the caller no longer wants — or, in the
 * eviction direction, deletes an entry a SUCCESSOR already installed.
 *
 * This module was extracted after the pattern was hand-rolled four times and
 * its absence was a review finding twice:
 *
 * - `clients/dispatch/runners/utils/runner-helpers.ts` held the guarded form
 *   at one site and the unguarded form at another IN THE SAME FILE; #1674's
 *   F5 round copied the guard by hand to three more write sites.
 * - `clients/lsp/client.ts`'s per-(path, identifier) pull sequences (#1682),
 *   whose first guard was vacuous until a review round bound it.
 * - `clients/lsp/workspace-diagnostics-cache.ts`'s per-cwd epochs (#1669),
 *   where the epoch guarded `persist()` but not `lookup()`.
 * - `clients/review-graph/builder.ts`'s workspace-cache epoch, the shape the
 *   one above was modelled on.
 *
 * Two things every one of those needed and at least one got wrong:
 *
 * 1. The check must run at WRITE time, not only at capture time.
 * 2. The stale branch must be OBSERVABLE. A silently dropped write looks
 *    exactly like a write that never happened, which is why the vacuous
 *    guards survived review. `guardedWrite` emits one bounded degradation
 *    record per (source, subject) with the count of repeats, so a dogfood
 *    session can tell "the guard is working" from "the guard never fires".
 *
 * ## Scope and lifetime
 *
 * A `GenerationSource` is a plain counter owned by the RESETTING SEAM — the
 * function that already clears the state the generation protects. This module
 * holds no session state of its own: sources live in the modules that create
 * them, and their reset policy is that module's declaration in
 * `tests/support/session-state-registry.ts`. The only module-level state here
 * is the name registry below, which exists so the #1754 sweep can ask "which
 * stores declare a generation" instead of guessing from identifier names.
 *
 * ## Cost
 *
 * `isCurrent()` on an unkeyed source is a field read and a compare. On a
 * keyed map it is a compare while nothing has been invalidated, and a
 * normalize plus one `Map.get` once something has. The hand-rolled form it
 * replaces normalized on EVERY call, and this repo's normalizer runs
 * `realpathSync.native` on Windows, so an uninterrupted sweep pays that
 * syscall once rather than once per file. See
 * `GenerationMapOptions.normalizeKey` for the correctness reason the slow
 * path exists at all.

 * ## Stamps, not per-key counters
 *
 * A stamp is drawn from ONE monotonic ticket counter shared by every key, so
 * no two keys ever hold the same stamp and no stamp is issued twice. That is
 * what makes dropping a key safe. A per-key counter starting at 0 fails OPEN:
 * drop the key and it reads 0 again, which is exactly the value a first-use
 * handle holds, so that handle reads current and its stale write lands. With
 * map-wide tickets, a forgotten or evicted key reads 0, and 0 is a stamp no
 * live handle can hold, so every outstanding handle for that key reports
 * stale.
 *
 * Treat the number as OPAQUE. It orders nothing and counts nothing; the only
 * meaningful operation is equality against a captured stamp.
 *
 * ## Bounded, and fail-closed at the bound
 *
 * Eviction drops the oldest key. Its outstanding handles then read 0 and drop
 * their writes, the same outcome a real invalidation produces, so the bound
 * costs correctness nothing and only costs work.
