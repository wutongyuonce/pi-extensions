/**
 * Single source of truth for "scratch/cache tree" exclusion, shared by every
 * runner that hands a DIRECTORY to an external binary and lets that binary do
 * its own tree walk.
 *
 * pi-lens's own in-process walkers (`source-filter.ts`/`source-walker.ts`,
 * `getProjectIgnoreMatcher`) already route every entry through
 * `isExcludedDirName`/`EXCLUDED_DIRS` (`file-utils.ts`) — that's how knip,
 * jscpd, and the tree-sitter project scan skip `.pi/`, `node_modules/`, etc.
 * But a runner that shells out with `cwd`/`--source <dir>` and lets the
 * EXTERNAL tool walk (gitleaks `detect --source`, `trivy fs`, `opengrep scan
 * <dir>`) bypasses that walker entirely — the tool sees the raw tree,
 * including pi-ecosystem scratch/data directories that were never meant to be
 * scan targets (#1562: `.pi/greedysearch-sources/` — a gitignored web-research
 * cache — served a `YOUR_API_KEY` doc-example placeholder to the agent as a
 * "leaked secret").
 *
 * This module derives each such runner's native exclude syntax from the SAME
 * `EXCLUDED_DIRS` list `file-utils.ts` already uses for the in-process walk,
 * rather than hand-maintaining a parallel per-tool list (the single-source-of-
 * truth rule that #883 encodes — a hand-copied list is a defect in itself:
 * `dead-code-client.ts`'s `VULTURE_EXCLUDES` had drifted from `EXCLUDED_DIRS`
 * before this fix, e.g. missing `.pi`/`.claude`/`.next`).
 *
 * Deliberately NOT `.gitignore`-based: a secrets scanner (gitleaks, trivy's
 * `secret` scanner) must still see an untracked `.env` with a real credential
 * — `.env` is commonly gitignored, so blanket "respect .gitignore" would hide
 * exactly the file classes these scanners exist to catch (#1562 design note).
 * `EXCLUDED_DIRS` is a narrower, deliberate list of scratch/cache/vendor
 * directory NAMES (`.pi`, `.claude`, `node_modules`, `dist`, …), not a
 * gitignore pattern set.
 *
 * TWO exclusion tiers, not one (#1562 review-round F1) — `EXCLUDED_DIRS`
 * itself conflates two different questions:
 *   - "don't bother INDEXING/LINTING/DEDUPING this" (the walker-parity
 *     exports below, `getScratchTreeGlobPatterns`/`getScratchTreeDirNames`/
 *     `getScratchTreeFnmatchPatterns`) — correctly broad: build output
 *     (`dist`, `build`, `out`, `target`, `coverage`), vendored source
 *     (`vendor`, `third_party`, `vendors`), and editor config (`.vscode`)
 *     are all noise for knip/jscpd/vulture.
 *   - "don't bother looking for SECRETS here" — a much narrower question.
 *     The first cut of this fix reused the walker-parity list for gitleaks's
 *     secrets-lane exclusion too, and a review probe caught it silently
 *     dropping real AWS-shaped secrets seeded in `dist/`, `vendor/`,
 *     `.vscode/`, `build/`, `out/`, `target/`, `third_party/`,
 *     `third-party/`, `coverage/` (0/9 kept, unlogged) — a bundler can bake
 *     a real key into `dist/`, `.vscode/launch.json` commonly carries a
 *     committed debug token, and a vendored tree can carry an upstream
 *     leak. `SECRETS_LANE_SCRATCH_DIR_NAMES`/`getSecretsLaneAllowlistPaths`/
 *     `isUnderSecretsLaneScratchTree` are the narrow tier gitleaks (or any
 *     future gitleaks-shaped secret scanner) must use instead — pi-ecosystem/
 *     agent data dirs, `node_modules`, `.git`, and generic build/package-
 *     manager CACHES only; every real-leak-surface directory above stays
 *     fully in scope.
