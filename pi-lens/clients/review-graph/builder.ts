// v3 (#260): test files are no longer indexed. Bumping the version makes
// loadPersistedGraph reject any v2 snapshot (which still contains test-file
// nodes/edges) → a clean tests-free rebuild on first load after upgrade, for
// every project, without anyone deleting the cache by hand.
// v4 (#655, narrow first slice): symbol-node IDs changed shape from
// `<file>:<name>` to `<file>:<name>:<kind>:<startLine>` (see symbol-id.ts) to
// stop overloads/same-named methods/nested functions from colliding onto one
// node. A v3 snapshot's nodes/edges still use the old ID shape throughout, so
// it must be rejected rather than merged with newly-built v4 IDs — same
// safe-rebuild mechanism as the v2→v3 bump above.
// v5 (#694): import resolution now prefers a `.ts`/`.tsx`/`.mts`/`.cts` source
// twin over a compiled `.js`/`.mjs`/`.cjs` sibling (jsTsCandidatePaths), and
// node creation is gated against untracked-AND-gitignored targets (see
// git-tracked-ignore.ts). A v4 snapshot from a compile-in-place project has
// cross-file import edges materialized on the compiled artifact nodes
// throughout (up to 100% of them, per #694's measurement) — merging that with
// newly-built v5 edges would leave the graph in mixed, partially-corrected
// state. Same safe-rebuild mechanism as the v2→v3/v3→v4 bumps above.
// v6 (#703): `getProjectIgnoreMatcher` is now tracked-aware — a TRACKED file
// that merely matches a `.gitignore`/global pattern (e.g.
// `clients/test-runner-client.ts` vs. `.gitignore`'s `test-*.ts`) is no
// longer dropped from the walk. A v5 snapshot built before this fix is
// missing those nodes entirely (never walked, never parsed) and instead has
// phantom compiled-artifact nodes standing in for them (0 symbols, importer
// edges materialized on the wrong node) — merging that with newly-walked v6
// nodes would leave the phantom AND the real node coexisting. Same
// safe-rebuild mechanism as the v2→v3/v3→v4/v4→v5 bumps above.
// v7 (#939): the canonical snapshot is streamed gzip. A v7 payload in the
// legacy uncompressed filename remains readable for one compatibility release.
// v8 (#1070): call/reference evidence now records call-like vs type-only
// references and tree-sitter query coverage, so call-graph consumers cannot
// mistake incomplete extraction for a clean zero.

// pre-cap graph while the repo is confirmed over cap, and consumers
// (project_report) can read it to render an honest "disabled, not cold" hint
// instead of "retry shortly".
//

// there's no cross-process staleness gap worth the extra persistence
// machinery `too-many-source-files` needed (that verdict is cached across
// process starts specifically to skip a slow walk — this one is a cheap
// flag alongside a walk that already ran).
//
// TTL default matches project-report.ts's STALE_THRESHOLD_MS (15 minutes):

// --- Cross-session resumable full build (checkpointing, #936 limit 2) ---
// A full build walks + tree-sitter-parses every source file, then resolves
// cross-file edges once at the end. On a large repo with short-lived sessions
// that whole pass can be killed before it finishes and, with no checkpoint,
// the next session starts from scratch — so it may NEVER complete. During the
// full-build extraction loop we periodically snapshot the PRE-resolution graph
// plus the exact set of files already folded into it (with content hashes) to
// a dedicated checkpoint file. A later session resumes from that snapshot,
// re-walking only files that changed/appeared since, and finishes the build.
//
// Correctness (equivalence to a cold full build) rests on one property of the
// extraction: `addFileToGraph`'s per-file contribution (the nodes it adds and
// the edges it adds, with their metadata) depends ONLY on that file's content
// and the cwd — never on other files or on processing order, because ALL
// cross-file linking is deferred to `resolveDeferredSymbolEdges`, run once
// after every file is in. So the pre-resolution graph is the order-independent
// union of per-file contributions (shared placeholder / imported-file stub
// nodes are created idempotently by id). Resuming therefore reconstructs the
// identical pre-resolution graph as long as the reused files' contributions
// are still current — which the content-hash + ignored-id + git gates below
// enforce, failing open to a cold build on any doubt.
