/**
 * Module Report (#245) — a structured, navigable substitute for raw full-file
 * reads. An agent calls this to understand a module's shape (outline, signatures,
 * who-uses-this) before requesting exact source, so `read` becomes the fallback
 * rather than the default.
 *
 * Language-uniform by construction: the outline is extracted for EVERY supported
 * language through the one tree-sitter symbol extractor (jsts uses the
 * `typescript` query), giving the same fields — name/kind/startLine/endLine/
 * signature/exported — across all 18 SYMBOL_QUERIES languages plus jsts. The
 * review graph supplies cross-file enrichment (who-uses-this, complexity, fanout)
 * merged onto entries by symbol name; that enrichment is additive and varies by
 * language (e.g. complexity exists for jsts), which is honest rather than faked.
 *
 * Single mode (no depth knob — #256). READ-ONLY by contract — it never builds a
 * graph and never calls an LSP server on this path (both repeatedly OOM'd pi when
 * an agent fanned out reports). Every call:
 *   1. tree-sitter extract of THE one file (always; cold-safe structure).
 *   2. language-agnostic inline executable extraction over the same tree-sitter
 *      AST (callbacks/closures/lambdas/function literals; no second parse).
 *   3. read the already-built review graph (in-memory, else the persisted disk
 *      snapshot) for who-uses-this / flags / imports — never a build. Cold cache
 *      → outline only.
 * `semantic.source` reflects who-uses-this provenance: "review-graph" when the
 * cached graph backs it, "unavailable:file-cap" when a size verdict disabled the
 * graph, else "none" (cold). Live-LSP enrichment is re-homed to #236, where LSP
 * writes provenance-tagged edges INTO the graph (once, persisted) for this path
 * to read as "graph-lsp". That logic lives in clients/module-report-lsp.ts.
 *
 * Guard integrity: moduleReport injects NO read records — an outline is not
 * "having seen the body". readSymbol returns the actual body lines so the host
 * can record a read that legitimately satisfies the read-guard for that symbol.
