/**
 * Cross-process instance registry (#449 slice 1).
 *
 * Observability substrate for multi-agent LSP resource sharing. Records, in
 * a single machine-global file (`~/.pi-lens/instances.json`), every live
 * pi-lens process: its pid, project root, live LSP child servers, RSS, and a
 * heartbeat timestamp. Later slices (cross-process budget, same-root warm
 * attach) build on this; slice 1 is purely observational — it changes no
 * dispatch/LSP behavior, it only records state and reaps stale entries /
 * orphaned LSP children (#472).
 *
 * File shape: `{ instances: InstanceEntry[] }`. Missing or corrupt file is
 * treated as `{ instances: [] }` — this module must never throw on a read.
 *
 * Concurrency: every whole-file writer holds the adjacent `<registry>.lock`
 * O_EXCL lock across its read-modify-write. Contenders use 5-25ms jittered
 * backoff for up to 500ms; stale locks older than 5s or owned by a dead pid
 * are displaced and reclaimed. A crash can still leave a stale lock during
 * that window, so takeover remains deliberately bounded and observable.

 * differ. Warm attach needs `"exact"`: it shares one LSP service, which is
 * bound to a specific project root. The shared-checkout guard needs
 * `"containment"`: a peer registered at the repo root and a command run from

 * peer and allow the destructive command. Containment compares on segment
 * boundaries, so `/repo-backup` never matches `/repo`.
