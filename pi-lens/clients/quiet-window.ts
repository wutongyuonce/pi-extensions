/**
 * Quiet-window scheduler for pi 0.80.6's `agent_settled` extension event (#483).
 *
 * `agent_settled` fires after the SDK's `_runAgentPrompt` finally-block sets
 * `_isAgentRunActive = false` — i.e. once the whole agent run (including any
 * auto-retry/continue loop) is fully done, on BOTH normal completion and
 * aborts/errors (it lives in a `finally`, not a success-only branch). It
 * fires strictly after `agent_end`/`turn_end` for that run. Unlike
 * `turn_end` — which fires while the next turn may already be looming and
 * therefore bounds its cascade-settle wait tightly — `agent_settled` is a
 * genuine idle window: nothing else is queued behind it until the user
 * types again. That makes it the right home for expensive, deferrable work
 * that would otherwise contend with live per-edit traffic.
 *
 * Feature detection: the SDK's extension registration (`pi.on(event, fn)`)
 * pushes onto a plain `Map<string, handler[]>` keyed by the literal event
 * string, with no allowlist or validation — registering an unknown event
 * name is a silent no-op on older hosts (the emit side only look up
 * handlers for events it actually emits). Registration therefore can't
 * throw; we still wrap it in try/catch defensively, and every task run
 * through this scheduler is independently isolated so a host that never
 * fires the event simply never executes them.
 *
 * The SDK awaits each registered handler in sequence
 * (`core/extensions/runner.js` `emit()`), and that `emit()` call is itself
 * awaited inside `_emitAgentSettled()`, which is awaited inside
 * `_runAgentPrompt`'s `finally`. A slow handler would therefore delay
 * `_runAgentPrompt` returning — so the handler registered here must not
 * await the task chain; it kicks the chain off unawaited (fire-and-forget)
 * and returns immediately.
