/**
 * Publishes `pilens:files:touched` on pi's shared `pi.events` bus (#482).
 *
 * This is pi-lens's FIRST `pi.events` broadcast surface: it exists so other
 * extensions in the same session can observe files pi-lens writes
 * autonomously (autofix/format runners) without reverse-engineering us —
 * writes the agent makes itself via its own tool calls are NOT ours to
 * broadcast; the host already knows about those (see the seam audit in
 * AGENTS.md / issue #482).
 *
 * Versioning policy: the payload is frozen-additive. New optional fields may
 * be added under the same `v: 1`; a breaking/incompatible change to an
 * existing field's meaning must bump `v`.
 *
 * Fire-and-forget: publishing must never affect the write path's success or
 * latency. Any failure (bus unavailable, emit throws) is swallowed; a `dbg`
 * callback is invoked at most once on first failure so a wired caller can log
 * it without spamming.
