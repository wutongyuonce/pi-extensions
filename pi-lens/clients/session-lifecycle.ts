/**
 * Concurrent-session guard (#473).
 *
 * In-process subagent extensions (tintinweb/pi-subagents-style: a fresh
 * `AgentSession` built and `bindExtensions()`-ed inside the SAME Node process
 * as the parent pi session) reuse pi's process-global extension-loader cache,
 * so the subagent's `session_start` re-invokes pi-lens's SAME module-scope
 * singletons the parent is still using. Left unguarded, `handleSessionStart`
 * destructively resets shared state (`resetLSPService({fast:true})` kills
 * every live LSP client; `runtime.resetForSession()` bumps the session
 * generation, silently orphaning the parent's in-flight continuations gated
 * on `isCurrentSession`) while the parent is mid-turn.
 *
 * pi's own SDK contract only invalidates a captured ctx for SEQUENTIAL
 * session replacement (`newSession`/`fork`/`switchSession`/`reload` —
 * `ExtensionRunner.invalidate()`, called from `core/agent-session.js` on
 * dispose). A concurrently-live sibling session's bind invalidates nothing.
 * That asymmetry — is the PRIOR ctx still active or not — is the reliable,
 * empirically-verified discriminator this module implements.
 *
 * Fail-safe direction is non-negotiable: whenever classification is
 * uncertain, this module falls back to today's behavior (treat as a
 * sequential replacement, i.e. run the full reset). It only suppresses the
 * reset on POSITIVE evidence that a live sibling primary session exists.
 *
 * Kill switch: `PI_LENS_CONCURRENT_SESSION_GUARD=0` disables the guard
 * entirely — every session_start classifies as if sequential (today's
 * behavior), matching the lazy-env-read house style (see
 * `subagent-mode.ts` / `runtime-config.ts`).

 *     keep today's behavior, NOT be mistaken for a sibling).
 *  3. Prior exists, `priorCtxActive === false` (confirmed invalidated) →

 *  4. Prior exists, `priorCtxActive === true`, different session id →

 *  6. Prior exists, `priorCtxActive === undefined` (probe inconclusive) →
 *     `sequential-replacement` (fail toward today's behavior).
 *
 * WHY ROOT IDENTITY IS AN INPUT AT ALL (#2129). Branch 3 alone made a subagent
 * temp worktree — a session_start in a DIFFERENT directory, arriving after the
 * host's real session had already been disposed or had an unprobeable ctx —
 * classify as a sequential replacement. It then re-registered itself as the
 * process's primary and ran the full session_start body: `resetLSPService`
 * killed the host's warm LSP fleet, and the whole async battery (opengrep,
 * word-index rebuild, review-graph build) re-ran per temp root over content
 * that had not changed. Two temp roots in one host cost ~50s of opengrep and
 * ~53s of word-index rebuild EACH, and drove host RSS from 290MB to 1.1GB in
 * four minutes.
 *
 * A start in a different root is therefore never allowed to steal primary. It
 * is a `secondary-root`, which the caller treats exactly like a
 * `concurrent-secondary`: skip the destructive resets and the expensive
 * battery, leave the registered primary's ctx/session id/root untouched. The
 * root still gets served — `initLSPConfig` registers session roots lazily,
 * per file (`clients/lsp/session-roots.ts:48`), not from this handler.
 *
 * Ordering note: the root check sits BELOW the `priorCtxActive === true`
 * branch so a live sibling still reports the more specific
 * `concurrent-secondary`, and it deliberately fires even when
 * `priorCtxActive === false`. "The prior ctx was invalidated" is exactly the
 * state a temp-worktree start arrives in, so deferring to it would restore the
 * defect.
 *
 * Accepted trade-off: an in-process SEQUENTIAL replacement that genuinely
 * moves to a new directory (a host that switches sessions across cwds within
 * one process) now takes the reduced path instead of a full start. It keeps
 * working — the LSP still attaches per file — but skips the startup battery
 * for the new root until a same-root start re-registers. `sameRoot` is only
 * ever `false` on positive evidence, and

 * `false` (dead ctx), and classified `sequential-replacement`, so it took over
 * as the new primary. Root identity made that stale state DECISIVE — a start in
 * a different root behind a dead-but-still-registered primary now classifies
 * `secondary-root` and declines. Without an explicit release, root A's primary
 * ending would mean every later start in root B declines FOREVER: never
 * primary, never a full start, no re-arm.
 *
 * This is the catalog's process-lifetime-latch shape (state that must re-arm at
 * a session boundary must not outlive it). `session_shutdown`'s primary path is
 * that boundary. Deliberately NOT called on a secondary's shutdown — that path
 * returns before the shared teardown precisely because the primary is still
 * live.
 *
 * A concurrent secondary that outlives the primary now classifies `primary` on
 * its later emissions rather than `concurrent-secondary`. That is the fail-safe
 * direction this module has always taken (run the handler), and it is correct
 * here: with the primary gone there is no live sibling to protect.
 *
 * WHAT PROTECTS A SURVIVING SECONDARY (#2130 round 2, remainder N3/F3). Not the
 * count zeroed below, and not this module-level classification at all: it is the
 * per-activation `ownedSessionRole` closure in `index.ts`. Each activation
 * records the role IT was classified as at its own session_start and consults
 * that at its own shutdown, so a secondary whose primary has already released
 * still takes the secondary teardown path.
 *
 * `secondarySessionCount` is therefore an OBSERVABILITY counter, not a guard.
 * Zeroing it here under-reports for the window between the primary's release
 * and the next primary's registration. That is real and accepted: the only
 * reader is `concurrent_session_bind.metadata.secondaryCount` in `latency.log`,
 * and during that window no primary is registered, so every arriving start
 * classifies `primary` and re-registers — which zeroes the count anyway —
 * instead of emitting a bind record. `decrementSecondarySessionCount` clamps at
 * zero, so a late secondary's shutdown cannot underflow it. Documented rather
 * than changed, because a count that outlived the registration it is scoped to

 * (positive evidence the shutting-down session is a live sibling, not the
 * real parent exiting). Any inconclusive signal — no primary registered,
 * same ctx object, same session id, EITHER session id unknown, or the
 * primary's ctx probe returning `undefined`/`false` — classifies as
 * `primary` so today's full-teardown behavior is preserved.
 *
 * The id-unknown guard matters: without it, a single ordinary session whose
 * `sessionManager.getSessionId()` is unavailable (SDK drift) would register
 * with `sessionId === undefined`, then at its OWN shutdown the same-id check
 * couldn't fire, the probe of its own (still-live — pi invalidates on
 * replacement, not shutdown) ctx would return true, and its teardown would
 * be skipped on EVERY clean exit — leaking the LSP fleet (the #472 orphan
 * class). Trade-off accepted: a REAL secondary that also has unknown ids
 * now classifies `primary` (conservative miss — its teardown runs and hurts
 * the parent, same as pre-#473 behavior), because uncertainty must never
 * classify `secondary`.
 *
 * ROOT IDENTITY (#2146 review F1). The probe-based branch above is the only
 * evidence this function had, and it is exactly the evidence that is missing in
 * the state #2146 describes: the host's ctx is already invalidated, which is
 * WHY `secondary-root` fires on the start side. A subagent's teardown therefore
 * read "the primary's ctx is dead, so I must be the primary", and index.ts's
 * primary path called `releasePrimarySession()` and wiped the SHARED process
 * registration. The decline then survived exactly one subagent: the next one
 * classified `primary` and ran the full battery.
 *
 * So this function takes the same root discriminator `decideSessionStart` has,
 * with the same rule and the same fail-safe direction. A shutdown whose root is
 * POSITIVELY different from the registered primary's root is a `secondary`,
 * even when the primary's ctx probes `false` or `undefined` — deferring to the
 * dead-ctx branch is what restored the defect. `undefined` on either side means
 * "root unknown" and changes no verdict.
 *
 * Ordering: the root check sits BELOW the id-unknown guard, not above it. That

 * when the ids that identify sessions are unavailable.
