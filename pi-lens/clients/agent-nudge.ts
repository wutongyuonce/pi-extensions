/**
 * Inline agent nudge for out-of-view file mutations (#485).
 *
 * Autofixes applied DURING a tool call surface in that tool's result — the
 * agent sees those today, and since #1464 the paths whose post-fix bytes
 * actually rode along in that result are dropped from the nudge rather than
 * told to re-read what they already hold (`noteAuthoritativeContentAttachment`
 * below). Everything that lands AFTER the tool result
 * (deferred-cascade autofixes settling at turn_end, quiet-window work (#483),
 * and — later — writes by other extensions once pi-lens consumes bus events)
 * is invisible to the model. This module closes that gap: it subscribes to
 * the `pilens:files:touched` bus event pi-lens itself publishes (#482,
 * clients/bus-publish.ts), accumulates touched paths per turn-gap, filters
 * them down to files the session actually read or edited (the read-guard
 * already tracks this — an untouched file's autoformat is not the agent's
 * business), and injects ONE terse message at the next turn via the same
 * `context`-event channel index.ts already uses for turn-end findings
 * (clients/runtime-context.ts). `context` (`transformContext` in the SDK,
 * dist/core/sdk.js) fires before EVERY provider/LLM call, including the
 * first call of a brand-new `agent_start` run in the same session — not just
 * mid-run turn boundaries. That matters: the primary real-world case this
 * solves is an agent that runs `git status` at the start of a fresh run and
 * finds files it did not knowingly modify, because pi-lens autoformatted
 * them at a PREVIOUS run's turn_end. The accumulator therefore survives
 * across agent_end/agent_settled — it is only ever cleared inside
 * `consumeAgentNudge`, i.e. at actual injection time.
 *
 * Three channels, three audiences (doctrine, see AGENTS.md):
 *   - bus events    -> EXTENSIONS (#482)
 *   - display-only  -> the HUMAN (#484)
 *   - context nudge -> the MODEL (this module, #485)
 * One feed (`pilens:files:touched`), three deliveries.
 *
 * Loop-guard alignment with #482: this subscriber is READ-ONLY on the bus —
 * it never calls `publishFilesTouched` (or anything else that emits on the
 * bus). ingest -> nudge can therefore never become ingest -> write -> publish;
 * there is no write side to this module at all, so the origin flag #482
 * defined for its own future consumers has nothing to trip here.
 *
 * Feature detection: `pi.events.on(channel, handler)` per
 * node_modules/@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent/dist/core/event-bus.d.ts;
 * `pi.events` itself is typed at
 * dist/core/extensions/types.d.ts:977. Both are guarded with optional
 * chaining / try-catch so an older host that lacks `pi.events` (or a future
 * host that removes `.on`) simply never wires the subscriber — no throw, no
 * behavior change beyond "no nudges".

 * unexplained working-tree drift, which no longer applies once the local
 * feed has also seen it. In code: "local" is sticky — once set, a later

 * cross-process into two separate injections; the agent gets one coherent
 * picture of everything unexplained in the working tree), but the wording
 * must never assign a LOCAL file to another instance:
 *   - all local         → "after your last turn" (the original #485 wording,
 *                         unchanged — verified by the pre-existing #485
 *                         tests);

 *   - mixed             → "after your last turn (N of them by an automatic
 *                         run outside it)" — the base framing stays local
 *                         and the cross-process portion is counted out
 *                         precisely, so no local file is ever misattributed.
 *
 * The cross-process wording names the ACTION, not the process identity. It
 * used to read "by another pi-lens instance (e.g. a subagent's)", which sent
 * agents investigating what other instance was running — the exact behavior
 * this nudge exists to prevent. Which process formatted the file is an
 * implementation detail the reading agent cannot act on; that it was an
 * automatic run outside their turn is the whole actionable content. The
 * origin split stays exact in the telemetry for human debugging.
 *
 * Clears the accumulator ONLY here, on actual injection — never on
 * agent_end/agent_settled/turn_start. Files formatted at the last turn_end of
 * a PREVIOUS run must still nudge at the first turn of the NEXT run in the
 * same session: this function is invoked from the `context` extension event
 * (index.ts), which fires before every provider/LLM call — including the
 * very first call of a fresh `agent_start` — so the accumulator surviving
 * across run boundaries is exactly what makes that cross-run delivery work.
 * Empty accumulator ⇒ returns undefined ⇒ zero bytes injected.
