/**
 * Production event-loop occupancy monitor (#192 Phase 2).
 *
 * pi-lens runs on pi's TUI event loop; a long synchronous block freezes
 * keystrokes. Our telemetry historically logged phase *durations*, which can't
 * distinguish a TUI-freezing synchronous burst from harmless async/subprocess
 * time — that blind spot let a ~1.5s enumeration freeze through (#188/#191).
 *
 * This wraps Node's native `perf_hooks.monitorEventLoopDelay()` — a histogram
 * of how late the loop services its own timer, i.e. how long it was blocked —
 * with **no per-event JS overhead**. `max` ≈ the worst synchronous block since
 * the last reset.
 *
 * ## System-stall contamination (#1122 / #1123)
 *
 * `monitorEventLoopDelay` measures timer lag with the monotonic clock
 * (`uv_hrtime`, backed by `QueryPerformanceCounter` on Windows). When the whole
 * process is frozen or descheduled — machine sleep / Modern Standby, or paging
 * thrash under commit-charge exhaustion — its next timer fires late by the
 * *entire* wall-clock gap, and the histogram records that gap as a "block".
 * Two distinct system stalls were confirmed against the Windows System event
 * log: (1) a 290,179 ms block that lined up exactly with a 14:33:05Z→14:37:55Z
 * Modern Standby window (Kernel-Power 506/507), reported byte-identical by two
 * independent pids because the HDR histogram quantizes ~290 s into one bucket;
 * (2) a later silent host exit with zero sleep events but twelve
 * Resource-Exhaustion-Detector (id 2004) events at 97% commit charge — the
 * process was paging, not sleeping. Both are machine artifacts, not pi-lens
 * work; latency.log also held multi-*hour* "blocks" that can only be overnight
 * sleep.
 *
 * Comparing a wall clock to a monotonic clock does NOT catch these: on Windows
 * both advance across Modern Standby (the histogram's monotonic delta already
 * equalled the wall gap). The reliable discriminator is **CPU consumption**: a
 * genuine synchronous block of D ms burns ≈ D ms of main-thread CPU, so the
 * window that contains it must have consumed at least ~D ms of CPU. A frozen or
 * thrashing process consumes ~0 CPU across the gap, so when the worst block
 * exceeds all the CPU the window could account for, it was a stall, not work.
 * We window per turn (so the CPU accounting is bounded and each block is
 * attributable to its turn) and tag system-stall-suspected samples instead of
 * letting them poison the "worst real block" high-water.

 * histogram or a real machine stall — the same reason
 * {@link isSuspendSuspectedBlock} is pure.
 *
 * ## Why this is sound in exactly one direction
 *
 * `windowCpuMs` is the CPU the WHOLE process consumed across the WHOLE window
 * — every thread, every phase, not just this block. So it is an UPPER BOUND on
 * the CPU this one block could have burned. A synchronous compute block of D ms
 * needs ≈ D ms of main-thread CPU. Therefore:
 *
 * - `windowCpuMs + slop < maxMs` PROVES the block was not compute. Even if the
 *   block had been the only thing running, there was not enough CPU in the
 *   whole window to cover it. This is the `non-cpu-stall` verdict and it is a
 *   real inference, not a heuristic.
 * - The converse proves nothing. A window can burn 30 s of CPU in other phases
 *   and still contain a 5 s I/O park. That is why the label is
 *   `cpu-accounted` ("the budget covers it") rather than "compute": it reports
 *   the absence of proof, not the presence of compute.
 *
 * The existing 20 s suspend verdict is not re-derived here; this delegates to
 * {@link isSuspendSuspectedBlock} so there is one definition of a suspend, and
 * `system-stall` is checked BEFORE `non-cpu-stall` because a suspend is the
 * strictly more specific case of the same evidence.
 *
 * ## Known ambiguity, carried forward not silenced
 *
 * `isSuspendSuspectedBlock`'s own doc records that a >20 s synchronous syscall
 * stall is CPU-indistinguishable from a suspend. Nothing here fixes that. What
 * this adds is the tier BELOW that floor: a 5-20 s non-CPU block, which used
 * to read as ordinary compute and now reads as `non-cpu-stall` with the
 * `inFlightPhase` attribution beside it.
