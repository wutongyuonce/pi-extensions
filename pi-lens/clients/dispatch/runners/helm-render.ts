/**
 * helm render — rendered-manifest validation for Helm charts (#1283 Slice B).
 *
 * Slice A (`helm-lint`) checks the chart's SOURCE. This runner checks what the
 * chart actually PRODUCES: it renders the chart with `helm template` and then
 * validates the rendered manifests. Three defect classes only the rendered
 * output can show:
 *
 *   1. **the render itself fails** — a missing `values` key, a nil pointer in a
 *      template expression, a dependency declared in `Chart.yaml` but absent
 *      from `charts/`. `helm lint` passes on plenty of charts that cannot be
 *      installed;
 *   2. **the rendered document is not a Kubernetes object** — a conditional
 *      that produced an empty or headless document, so `apiVersion`/`kind` are
 *      missing. `helm template` does not require them;
 *   3. **the rendered object is insecure** — privileged containers, missing
 *      resource limits, host-path mounts. Trivy's misconfiguration engine reads
 *      those off the manifest, and it has never been able to see them for a
 *      Helm chart because the manifest did not exist on disk.
 *
 * ## Opt-in, because rendering EXECUTES the chart
 *
 * `helm template` evaluates Go templates from the repository, and a chart can
 * carry `lookup`, `getHostByName`, or arbitrary `tpl` expansion. That is a trust
 * boundary, not a lint, so it is **off by default** and enabled per project:
 *
 * ```json
 * { "helm": { "renderValidation": { "enabled": true } } }
 * ```
 *
 * With the switch absent the runner never spawns anything at all.
 *
 * ## Two gates, because the switch ships INSIDE the repository
 *
 * `.pi-lens.json` is a tracked file, so a cloned repository can arrive with the
 * switch already on — a malicious chart repo would authorize execution of its
 * own templates just by containing the config that says so. Consent from the
 * repo is therefore necessary but not sufficient: the render also requires
 * PROJECT TRUST from the host (`getProjectTrustState()`), the same gate that
 * governs LSP spawns and tool installs. In untrusted mode the runner refuses to
 * spawn and says trust is the reason, rather than skipping silently.
 *
 * The consent lookup is keyed off the WORKSPACE ROOT whose chart is about to
 * run, not `ctx.cwd`. Those differ, and keying on the cwd let an opt-in in one
 * directory authorize rendering a chart belonging to a different project root.
 *
 * The Trivy pass keeps Trivy's OWN consent switch (`trivy.enabled`), because
 * that is the switch that authorizes installing the binary. Opting into
 * rendering therefore gets render + manifest-shape validation; the IaC pass
 * needs both switches. When Trivy is opted in but unavailable, the runner says
 * so as an `info` diagnostic — a missing pass must never read as a clean one.
 *
 * ## No repo writes
 *
 * Rendering goes to a scratch directory under `os.tmpdir()`, removed on every
 * exit path. The chart directory is never touched, and `--dependency-update` is
 * deliberately NOT passed: it would fetch archives into `charts/`. A missing
 * dependency is reported as a finding instead.
 *
 * ## Source mapping
 *
 * A finding the agent cannot locate is noise. Rendered manifests carry helm's
 * own `# Source: <chart>/templates/<file>` annotation, and `--output-dir` mirrors
 * that layout on disk, so every rendered file maps back to the template that
 * produced it. Lines do not survive rendering, so a mapped diagnostic sits at
 * line 1 of the template and names the rendered file and line in its message.
 * When mapping fails the diagnostic attaches to `Chart.yaml` with the rendered
 * path in the message.
