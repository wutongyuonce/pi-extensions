/**
 * The record a runner leaves when its parser read NOTHING out of output the
 * tool did produce (#1948).
 *
 * `skipUnlessToolRan` covers the adjacent case: the tool produced no output at
 * all. The hole it leaves is the one that hid five parser bugs for months —
 * vale (#1933), taplo, stylelint, phpstan (#1946), sqlfluff. Each received a
 * real report, extracted zero diagnostics from it, and reported "succeeded, 0
 * diagnostics", which is byte-for-byte what a genuinely clean file records.
 * A reader could not answer "is this file clean, or did the parser fail?".
 *
 * THE RULE: record only when the exit status is NONZERO, the output handed to
 * the parser is non-empty, and the parse yielded zero diagnostics. A nonzero
 * exit is the tool asserting something is wrong; extracting nothing from that
 * assertion means our reader disagrees with the tool, and one of the two is
 * broken.
 *
 * Exit 0 with zero parsed is deliberately NOT recorded, even with non-empty
 * output: that is the overwhelmingly common clean save. Linters print summary
 * banners, empty JSON arrays, and progress noise on a clean run, so a row per
 * clean save would drown the ledger and bury the real signal.
 *
 * FALSE NEGATIVES this rule accepts, stated plainly:
 *   - A tool that reports findings under exit 0. `swiftlint` is the live
 *     example among the adopters: a warning-only run exits 0 and still writes
 *     a full JSON array, so a swiftlint parser break that never trips a
 *     nonzero exit stays invisible here. (`vale` also exits 0 on findings by
 *     default, but its actual #1933 break exited 1, so it is not the example.)
 *     This gap is deliberate and is NOT closed by adding an output-length
 *     threshold for exit 0. That class belongs to the captured-fixture lane —
 *     `tests/clients/dispatch/runners/captured-real-output.test.ts` pins each
 *     parser against real recorded binary output, which catches a broken
 *     parser directly instead of guessing from output size. A length
 *     threshold here would fire on every clean run of every tool that prints
 *     a summary banner.
 *   - A tool whose parser breaks only for a SUBSET of findings still reports
 *     the ones it can read, so `parsedCount` is nonzero and nothing records.
 *
 * FALSE POSITIVES it accepts: a runner that legitimately parses zero
 * diagnostics out of a failing run — `go-vet` exits nonzero for a SIBLING
 * file's problem and then filters to the edited file, and `terragrunt` does
 * the same across a unit directory. Such runners stay off this helper rather
 * than being special-cased inside it; see the runner-family registries in
 * `tests/clients/dispatch/runners/parsed-nothing-sweep.test.ts`.
 *
 * Bounded by `incrementDegradationCount`: one latest-reason entry per
 * (kind, subject) with an exact tally, so a permanently broken parser costs
 * ONE ledger row and not one per dispatched file. `subject` is the tool id
 * because a parser break is a property of the tool and our reader of it, not
 * of the project it ran in; aggregating on the tool keeps exactly the identity
 * a reader needs ("which tool is stuck") while staying bounded across every
 * workspace in the session.
 *
 * @returns true when a row was recorded.
