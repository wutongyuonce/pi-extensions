 * signal, or never spawned at all. An empty result must distinguish clean from

 *   2. `status === null` with no error — no exit status ever arrived, so no
 *      analysis can be claimed. `did-not-run`.
 *   3. `reportMissing` — an artifact tool wrote no report. Nonzero exit means
 *      `report-missing`; exit 0 means a genuinely clean run that had nothing
 *      to write.
 *   4. A nonzero status outside the caller's declared `ran` table.
 *      `rejected-invocation`.
 *   5. A nonzero status with nothing to parse. `did-not-run` — a tool that
 *      analysed the file says SOMETHING, so silence plus failure is evidence
 *      it never got that far.
 * Everything else ran.
 *
 * Note what is deliberately NOT a non-ran path: a nonzero status WITH output
 * and no contradicting table. Most linters exit non-zero precisely because
 * they found something, and their findings are on stdout.
