/**
 * Shared availability policy for tool probes (#1467).
 *
 * A `--version` probe answers one question — "can I run this tool right now?" —
 * and it can fail for two very different reasons:
 *
 *   * the tool is **missing**: a durable fact about the machine, worth caching
 *     for the session and worth an "install it" message;
 *   * the probe was **transient**: a timeout, an abort, an EAGAIN. That is
 *     evidence about *this moment*, not about the tool. Caching it as a
 *     permanent `false` disables a healthy tool for the life of the process,
 *     and wording it as "not installed" sends the user to reinstall something
 *     that is already on disk.
 *
 * knip hit exactly that: a 5 s host-side probe budget, an event-loop stall that
 * ate most of it, a latched `false`, and three days of "Knip not available.
 * Install with: npm install -D knip" over a knip that answered `--version` in
 * 0.8 s outside the host. This module owns the policy so every client — the
 * `createAvailabilityChecker` seam, knip, madge, govulncheck, vulture — shares
 * one taxonomy, one retry rule, and one message split.
 *
 * Kept dependency-light on purpose (only the latency logger) so client modules
 * can import the policy without pulling in the dispatch/installer graph.
