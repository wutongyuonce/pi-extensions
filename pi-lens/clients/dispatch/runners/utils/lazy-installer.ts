/**
 * The one lazy-install seam (#1537).
 *
 * Best-effort installs of language-specific tools, triggered when a runner or a
 * formatter finds its tool absent. There were two copies of this — the
 * `attempted` Set here and `formatters.ts`'s `_lazyInstallAttempts` — and both
 * carried the same defect: the key went in BEFORE the install ran and never came
 * out. A `gem install rubocop` that died on a network blip was therefore never
 * retried for the rest of the session, and the tool stayed skipped.
 *
 * The guard itself is right, and it stays: an install storm is worse than a
 * missed install, and these spawns are up to 3 minutes each. What was wrong is
 * that a transient failure and a genuine refusal were recorded identically, with
 * no expiry on either. So the record is now written AFTER the install, and it
 * carries the outcome:
 *
 *   * `succeeded` — nothing more to do this session.
 *   * `failed`, transient (timed out, killed, EAGAIN) — retried after a
 *     cooldown, at most LAZY_INSTALL_MAX_TRANSIENT_ATTEMPTS times, then held.
 *   * `failed`, durable (the package MANAGER is not on this machine) — held for
 *     the session. No cooldown can conjure a `gem`.
 *
 * The vocabulary is #1534's `InstallAttemptFact`, so `describeInstallAttempt`
 * turns this record straight into the `availability_decision` install evidence
 * (#1500) — which is what makes "we tried and the network failed" tellable from
 * "this tool cannot be installed here".
 *
 * A trust denial is deliberately NOT recorded: `assertInstallAllowed` is
 * re-evaluated per call and a later grant must retry (#1350).

 * the window has to be far longer than a save interval or the guard is
 * decorative.
 *
 * The first cut wrote its own doubling formula with a 30-minute cap and a
