// seam so every decline the process's PRIMARY has seen this session —
// `concurrent-secondary` and `secondary-root` alike — is summarized in one row
// at session end instead of requiring a reader to hand-count
// `concurrent_session_bind` lines. Process-singleton backed (AGENTS.md catalog
// shape 25), NOT a module-scope `let` like the other `*_rollup` counters
// (bus-events-logger.ts, path-attribution-telemetry.ts): a `let` here exists
// once per module EVALUATION, not once per process, and #2146 measured one pid
// evaluating this exact graph nine times — a bare `let` would only ever see
// the binds routed through its own copy, undercounting every rollup that
// isn't reached through the first evaluation. `decideSessionStart` never
// returns a declined classification outside `concurrent-secondary`/
// `secondary-root` (session-lifecycle.ts), so those two are the whole
// contract; `unclassified` is a bounded third bucket for the legacy callers
// this function's `classification?` param still accepts.
