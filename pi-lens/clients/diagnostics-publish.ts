/**
 * Publishes `pilens:diagnostics` on pi's shared `pi.events` bus (#502).
 *
 * Sibling to `clients/bus-publish.ts` (the #482 `pilens:files:touched`
 * producer) rather than a new export crammed into that file: the two events
 * share the emit plumbing (`wireBusEmitter`) and the `PI_LENS_BUS_PUBLISH`
 * kill switch, but this producer owns its OWN piece of module state (the
 * previously-reported-paths set for clean-transition tracking, the seq
 * counter) that has nothing to do with files-touched.
 *
 * ## CONSUMER CONTRACT — staleness / replace semantics (2026-07-11 design, #502)
 *
 * Diagnostics are STATE; bus events are point-in-time snapshots of a slice of
 * that state. To guarantee a consumer can always reconstruct the latest
 * known picture from the event stream alone, this producer follows LSP
 * `publishDiagnostics` semantics:
 *
 * 1. **Full-replace per file, never a delta.** Every event carries the
 *    COMPLETE current diagnostic set for each file it mentions. An event
 *    mentioning path P replaces everything a consumer previously held for P
 *    — never merge/append across events for the same path.
 * 2. **Empty array = explicitly clean.** When a previously-reported file's
 *    diagnostics clear, this producer emits `{path, diagnostics: []}` for it
 *    exactly once, on the transition. Silence never means clean (the #240
 *    doctrine, applied here on the producer side) — a consumer that stops
 *    hearing about a path has learned NOTHING about its current state.
 * 3. **Monotonic `seq` + `ts` per emission.** `seq` increments once per
 *    `publishDiagnostics` call (module-level counter, process-lifetime
 *    monotonic — never reset except in tests). Out-of-order receipt resolves
 *    deterministically: higher `seq` always wins, lower is discarded.
 * 4. **`pilens:files:touched` (#482) is an INVALIDATION HINT, not new data.**
 *    Between an edit landing (a files:touched event) and the next
 *    diagnostics batch for that path, a consumer's previously-held
 *    diagnostics for that path are PROVISIONAL — the file has changed on
 *    disk but pi-lens hasn't re-analyzed it yet. Consumers that want to
 *    avoid rendering stale annotations across that window should treat a
 *    files:touched path as "diagnostics pending" until the next
 *    pilens:diagnostics event mentions it (at any seq).
 *
 * Late-joiners are a non-problem in-process: extensions activate at
 * `session_start`, before any turn emits, so v1 is push-only (no
 * request/replay). #478's future `pilens:rpc:diagnostics` pull API reuses
 * this exact `PilensDiagnosticsPayload` shape verbatim — push and pull are
 * two deliveries of the same schema over the same lens-engine seam; #478
 * stays separately gated on #449 registry dogfooding.
 *
 * ## Emission seam
 *
 * `publishDiagnostics` is called once per write batch immediately after
 * `recordDiagnostics` (clients/widget-state.ts) commits the FINAL per-file
 * diagnostic set for that batch — i.e. after format, autofix, and dispatch
 * have all run (see pipeline.ts's phase order). This guarantees the emitted
 * event reflects post-batch latest state, not an intermediate runner result:
 * widget-state's `allDiagnostics` store is exactly what `recordDiagnostics`
 * just wrote, so reading it back at the same call site can't race a later
 * write in the same batch.
 *
 * Versioning policy: frozen-additive, same discipline as #482. New optional
 * fields may be added under `v: 1`; a breaking change to an existing field's
 * meaning must bump `v`.
