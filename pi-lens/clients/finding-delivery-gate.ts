/**
 * Single documentation home for the finding-delivery gate stack (#1634).
 *
 * Every store that renders findings to the AGENT — the turn-end blocker/
 * advisory tiers, `lens_diagnostics` mode=full/all/delta, the widget/footer
 * tally, agent nudges, and the persisted project-diagnostics snapshot —
 * invented its own freshness and retirement rules across
 * #1461/#1561/#1622/#1631, so the stores drifted from each other and each new
 * store re-created the class. #1622/#1625/#1627/#1633 converged on two gates;
 * this module names them ONE time so every other file points here instead of
 * re-explaining the contract. `mode=delta` — the tool's DEFAULT mode — was
 * the review round's live catch: it re-served the actionable/quality-warnings
 * caches verbatim, unfixed by the earlier per-store passes because it sits
 * one layer up from any single scanner.
 *
 * ── Freshness (mtime vs scannedAt, onMissing policy) ──────────────────────
 * `gateFindingsByPathFreshness` (advisory-provenance.ts) partitions a cached
 * store's findings by what the cited path looks like NOW versus the scan
 * timestamp (`scannedAt`) the store was captured at:
 *   - missing  → `onMissing: "drop"` (default) removes the finding outright —
 *     right when the finding IS the file's content (a secret in a deleted
 *     file cannot be rotated). `onMissing: "demote"` keeps it — right when the
 *     cited path is only EVIDENCE for a finding pinned elsewhere (a
 *     govulncheck CVE is pinned by go.mod, not by the traced call site).
 *   - stale (mtime > scannedAt + MTIME_DRIFT_TOLERANCE_MS,
 *     `blocker-freshness.ts`) → DEMOTE, never drop. The finding survives,
 *     the now-untrustworthy line number does not.
 *   - live  → deliver unchanged, full authority.
 *   - unknown (unparseable/absent `scannedAt`, unreadable path) → fail OPEN,
 *     deliver unchanged. A missed demotion is noise; a wrong drop can hide a
 *     live credential or CVE.
 * The turn-end secrets (gitleaks/trivy-secrets) and govulncheck advisory both
 * route through this gate in `clients/runtime-turn.ts`.
 *
 * The SAME freshness family, one level up, covers cross-file drift: a cached
 * inline blocker is a verdict about its file *and everything that file
 * imports* — `clients/blocker-freshness.ts` (`sweepInlineBlockerFreshness`,
 * the widget-store counterpart `reconcileStaleWidgetDependencyBlockers`
 * paired with `reconcileStaleWidgetFiles`) stats the file and its forward
 * imports against the verdict's `recordedAtMs` baseline (#1631/#1633). A
 * drifted entry is demoted with the SAME `[stale — re-run to confirm]`
 * marker (`STALE_LINE_MARKER`, `clients/stale-marker.ts` — its own leaf
 * module so `widget-state.ts` can use it without a circular import back
 * through the turn orchestrator, #1631 review V2) and `isBlocking`
 * answers false for it — the one predicate both the footer tally and
 * `mode=all`'s blocking count consult, which is what keeps `mode=all` from
 * contradicting a same-minute `mode=full` sweep on the same paths (#1631
 * criterion 3 / #1634 criterion 4).
 *
 * Two INDEPENDENT gates share this `stale` field, distinguished by
 * `WidgetDiagnostic.staleReason`: `"dependency-drift"` (#1631, above) and
 * `"past-eof"` (#1641 — a cited line beyond the file's current on-disk length,
 * a stale in-memory LSP document diverged from disk). Each gate only HEALS
 * demotions it made itself (`staleReason` defaults to `"past-eof"` for
 * backward compatibility with pre-#1641 records) — composed, not merged into
 * one undifferentiated flag, so a fix for one hazard can never silently clear
 * the other's verdict.
 *
 * ── Dispositions (strict-only for blocking) ───────────────────────────────
 * `applyDispositions` (diagnostic-dispositions.ts) filters false-positive/
 * suppress/defer/flagged judgments the agent or user already recorded for a
 * finding. Anchoring is STRICT (line-content-hashed) only for false-positive
 * — a judgment about one exact piece of code that must NOT survive a rewrite
 * of that line — and WEAK (no line hash) for defer/flagged/suppress, which
 * are intent-level judgments that must survive incidental nearby edits.
 * `formatFullMode` (tools/lens-diagnostics.ts) applies this on every
 * mode=full pass; the per-edit dispatch path applies the identical filter
 * before writing into widget-state, so mode=all and the footer inherit
 * disposition state for any file that has gone through a live edit this
 * session WITHOUT re-computing it (kept cache-only and instant, #1634
 * criterion 5's documented exception — see "Explicit lag labels" below).
 *
 * ── Demotion rendering (#1419) ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 * A demoted finding is never silently dropped and never re-asserted at full
 * authority: it renders with `STALE_LINE_MARKER` (or the widget's `[stale]`
 * tag) in place of the coordinate the drift invalidated. This is the one
 * rendering convention every gated surface reuses — a store must not invent
 * its own "stale" wording.
 *
 * #1944 completes the rule: demotion must change the BODY, not only the
 * channel and the coordinate. A demoted body carries no STOP banner and no
 * "must be fixed" imperative, and a cited line the file no longer has renders
 * as `L<n> (line no longer exists)`. `clients/demoted-finding-render.ts`
 * (`degradeDemotedFindingBody`) is the one implementation for surfaces that
 * deliver a RENDERED BODY — the turn-end advisory tier. Per-row surfaces
 * (`clients/widget-state.ts`, `tools/lens-diagnostics.ts`) have no body to
 * degrade; they satisfy the same rule by dropping the authority marker
 * alongside the coordinate.
 *
 * ── Retirement (#1944) ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Demote-not-drop assumes the agent CAN re-run to confirm. A past-EOF
 * demotion breaks that assumption: the file shrank past the cited lines, so
 * no re-run can ever speak to them, and the record re-served on every turn
 * end for the life of the session. Such a record is delivered ONCE, degraded,
 * then retired (`RuntimeCoordinator.retireDemotedPastEofBlocker`). The
 * suppression is recorded in the degradation ledger under
 * `demoted-finding-retired`, whose subject keeps the store and file, and the
 * delivered payload says so in its own words — so an empty advisory section
 * can only mean "nothing to say". Dependency-drift demotions keep in-bounds
 * coordinates the agent can act on and are NOT retired.
 *
 * ── Explicit lag labels (the non-gated escape hatch) ──────────────────────
 * A store that cannot afford the freshness/disposition stack — because it
 * has no cited per-file path to stat (a package-pinned finding like a trivy
 * CRITICAL CVE or a license-risk row), or because re-computing dispositions
 * would cost the "instant" cache-only render mode=all/the footer promise —
 * MUST say so explicitly, with the finding's age, rather than presenting as
 * if it were current. `formatCacheAgeLabel` below is the one implementation;
 * every labeled surface in `DELIVERY_SURFACES` calls it instead of hand-
 * rolling an age string. This is the "(b)" arm of #1634's contract: every
 * agent-facing surface is EITHER gated OR explicitly labeled — never neither.
 */
