/**
 * Handle-origin tracer, institutionalized from the hand-rolled `async_hooks`
 * instrumentation the #1097 investigation used to find a leaked, ref'd
 * `setTimeout` keeping a `--print --no-session` process alive after
 * `agent_settled` (root-caused/fixed in #1110). The #1097 reporter explicitly
 * asked for a built-in active-resource dump (#1123 item 4) so the next
 * "process won't exit" report is a one-line diagnostic instead of a fresh
 * multi-hour expedition.
 *
 * `PI_LENS_DEBUG_HANDLES=1` (read ONCE at module load — i.e. must be set
 * before pi-lens starts, not toggled mid-session):
 *   - OFF (default): every export below is a no-op that returns immediately
 *     on the flag check — no writer constructed, no async_hooks hook
 *     installed, zero allocations on any hot path. `dumpActiveHandles` is
 *     called from live lifecycle hooks (index.ts `agent_settled` /
 *     `session_shutdown`), so this module must cost nothing when unset.
 *   - ON: (a) `dumpActiveHandles(label)` calls `process.getActiveResourcesInfo()`,
 *     tallies counts by resource type, and writes one ndjson line to
 *     `~/.pi-lens/debug-handles.log` via the standard `createNdjsonLogger`
 *     family (size-bounded, log-cleanup registered — the same rotation
 *     bounds every other pi-lens log gets, #1101-era registry via
 *     clients/ndjson-logger.ts's self-registration + clients/log-cleanup.ts).
 *     (b) an `async_hooks` creation-site tracker, installed at module load
 *     ONLY when the flag is on, records a trimmed `Error().stack` per
 *     tracked resource id for timer/socket/handle async-hook types and
 *     removes the entry on `destroy`. This is a real per-resource-creation
 *     cost — `async_hooks` hooks run on every init/destroy in the process —
 *     so it is strictly opt-in and documented here as a debug-only expense,
 *     never installed unless the flag was on before this module first loads.
 *
 * Bounded tracker (the one-axis-rule, AGENTS.md "resource bounded along one
 * axis but unbounded along another"): the creation-site map is capped at
 * `TRACKER_MAX_ENTRIES` before adding a new entry past the cap — never
 * unbounded growth even in a pathological timer-storm session. Eviction
 * protects the first `TRACKER_PROTECTED_COUNT` insertion-order entries and
 * evicts the oldest entry OUTSIDE that protected zone instead: a #1097-style
 * leaked handle is typically among the EARLIEST created in a session (it's
 * the one nothing ever cleaned up), so a naive drop-oldest policy would let a
 * later burst past the cap evict exactly the evidence this tracer exists to
 * capture, silently. `evictedCount` (a running total, always present on the
 * dump entry once the tracker is installed) makes any eviction — protected
 * or not — an explicit, visible fact instead of a silent gap in attribution.
