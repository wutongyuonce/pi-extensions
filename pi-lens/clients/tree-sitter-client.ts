/**
 * Tree-sitter Structural Search Client for pi-lens
 *
 * Inspired by pi-lsp-extension's search-engine.ts and pattern-compiler.ts
 * Provides AST-aware structural search with metavariable capture.
 *
 * Uses web-tree-sitter (WASM) for parsing - no native compilation needed.
 *
 * Pattern syntax:
 *   $NAME    - Matches any single AST node, captures as NAME
 *   $$$NAME  - Matches zero or more sibling nodes (variadic)
 *
 * Example:
 *   "console.log($MSG)" matches any console.log call, captures argument as MSG
 *   "function $NAME($$$PARAMS) { $BODY }" matches function declarations
