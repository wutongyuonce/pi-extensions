/**
 * Automatic smells self-surfacing (#1123 item 3).
 *
 * `scripts/analyze-pi-lens-logs.mjs` (`npm run logs:smells`) already detects
 * a wide catalogue of operational smells, but it is MANUAL — an operator has
 * to think to run it. The #1123 investigation found 20 stale-ctx
 * `emit_failed` rows (see `session-lifecycle.ts`'s stale-ctx guard) and 37
 * opengrep respawns sitting in logs for days before an audit went looking.
 * This module closes that gap with a small, ALWAYS-ON rollup that surfaces a
 * subset of the analyzer's smells without anyone running the script.
 *
 * COST BOUND (the constraint that shapes the design): `~/.pi-lens/*.log`
 * files are size-rotated at `PI_LENS_MAX_LOG_SIZE_MB` (default 10MB,
 * `clients/log-cleanup.ts`). Re-scanning a whole rotated log on every
 * `session_start` — the analyzer's own approach — is exactly the megabyte
 * full-file read `session_start` (a hot, input-latency-sensitive path, see
 * `runtime-session.ts`'s cold-start comment) cannot afford. So this module
 * does a BOUNDED TAIL READ: at most `SMELLS_TAIL_BYTES_PER_FILE` bytes from
 * the END of each source log, via a single `pread`-style `fs.readSync` at a
 * computed offset — never a full-file read, by construction (see
 * `tailReadText`). Two source files, ~64KB each: ~128KB total I/O, once per
 * session_start plus one bounded re-check every `SMELLS_TURN_CHECK_INTERVAL`
 * turns — negligible next to the multi-second full startup walk it rides
 * alongside.
 *
 * The tail scan is bounded, but the tail can contain prior-session rows. The
 * `session_start` and `turn_end` callers supply the in-process session
 * boundary (`runtime.sessionStartedAt`), and rows are admitted only when
 * their own UTC timestamp is at or after that boundary. `/lens-health` has
 * no per-session caller to anchor to (it can run at any point, including
 * outside a turn) so it omits `sessionStartMs` and falls back to
 * `SMELLS_ROLLING_WINDOW_MS` (24h) — its rendered line is labeled "last 24h
 * tail-scan" to say so explicitly rather than implying a session-scoped
 * count it isn't. This keeps the same bounded read without reporting
 * historical failures as current, so this module does not additionally
 * instrument the write call sites (`bus-publish.ts`, `clients/lsp/index.ts`'s
 * respawn path) with parallel live counters. That keeps the change contained
 * to one new module + three small call sites (session_start, `/lens-health`,
 * `turn_end`) instead of touching every producer of the two source logs.
 *
 * Smells covered (deliberately a SUBSET — the two the issue named as having
 * gone unnoticed; the full catalogue stays in the manual analyzer):
 *   - stale-ctx `emit_failed`: `bus-events.log` rows where
 *     `outcome === "emit_failed"` and `error` contains the SDK's
 *     `"stale after session replacement"` fragment (the known-benign class
 *     `session-lifecycle.ts` documents — still worth a glance if it recurs
 *     often, since a HIGH count could mask a real regression).
 *   - opengrep respawns: `latency.log` rows where
 *     `phase === "lsp_server_respawn"` and `metadata.serverId === "opengrep"`
 *     (`clients/lsp/index.ts`'s existing respawn log point — unmodified).
 *
 * Both counters are gated by trivial threshold constants (`SMELLS_THRESHOLDS`)
 * so a single stray event never surfaces noise — only a repeating pattern
 * does, matching the analyzer's own low/medium/high severity gating.
