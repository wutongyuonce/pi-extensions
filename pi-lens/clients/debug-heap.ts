/**
 * On-demand V8 heap-snapshot writer — the `PI_LENS_DEBUG_HEAP` sibling that
 * `clients/memory-sampler.ts`'s docstring names as the SEPARATE, explicitly
 * opt-in mechanism for #1126's acceptance criterion ("a heap snapshot of a
 * >1 GB instance identifying the dominant retainers"). The periodic
 * `memory_sample` latency.log line answers "how many bytes are resident right
 * now, broken down by subsystem, over time"; this answers the follow-up
 * question it cannot — "WHICH objects actually retain those bytes" — by writing
 * a `.heapsnapshot` an operator opens in Chrome DevTools › Memory (or clinic /
 * heapdump tooling). It is the retainer-attribution half of #1126's memory
 * observability, deliberately kept out of the always-on sampler because a heap
 * snapshot is expensive (see COST below).
 *
 * `PI_LENS_DEBUG_HEAP=1` (read ONCE at module load, exactly like
 * `debug-handles.ts` — a flag baked in at startup, never toggled mid-session):
 *   - OFF (default): every export below is a no-op that returns immediately on
 *     the flag check. No file is written, no `node:v8` snapshot work happens,
 *     no ndjson writer is constructed — zero cost on any path. The one caller,
 *     the on-demand `/lens-health` diagnostics command, guards on
 *     `isDebugHeapEnabled()` first, so an unset flag costs a single boolean
 *     read. This is NEVER wired to a hot hook, a timer, or a lifecycle event.
 *   - ON: `writeHeapSnapshotNow(label)` calls `v8.writeHeapSnapshot()` to
 *     `~/.pi-lens/heap-<pid>-<iso>.heapsnapshot` and appends ONE ndjson
 *     breadcrumb (path, pid, `rssBytes`, `durationMs`) to `heap-snapshots.log`
 *     via the standard size-bounded `createNdjsonLogger` family (same rotation
 *     bounds every other pi-lens log gets, #1101-era registry). The breadcrumb
 *     lets latency.log's `memory_sample` trajectory and the on-disk snapshot
 *     files cross-reference each other after the fact.
 *
 * COST: `v8.writeHeapSnapshot()` is a SYNCHRONOUS, multi-hundred-MB, multi-
 * second operation that pauses the whole process — which is exactly why it is
 * (a) strictly opt-in behind `PI_LENS_DEBUG_HEAP`, and (b) only ever invoked on
 * explicit operator demand via `/lens-health`, never on an automatic path.
 * Auto-capturing a snapshot when a `memory_sample` crosses an RSS threshold is
 * a DELIBERATELY-DEFERRED follow-up (see #1126) precisely because a threshold
 * trigger would reintroduce that multi-second pause onto an automatic path.
 *
 * Bounded axis (AGENTS.md recurring-defect shape 9 — "a resource bounded on one
 * axis while it grows on another"): the `.heapsnapshot` FILES are the growing
 * axis — each is large, and repeated `/lens-health` invocations accumulate them
 * — and unlike the breadcrumb log they are NOT ndjson-rotated. So every
 * `writeHeapSnapshotNow()` prunes the snapshot directory down to the newest
 * `SNAPSHOT_RETENTION` files after writing. Keeping the NEWEST N (not pinning
 * the earliest, the opposite of `debug-handles.ts`'s creation-site tracker) is
 * the correct policy HERE: an operator triggers each snapshot deliberately to
 * capture the CURRENT grown state of a long-lived instance, so the latest
 * snapshots ARE the evidence — there is no "leak hides among the earliest
 * handles" ordering to protect, as there is for the handle tracer.
