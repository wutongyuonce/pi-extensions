/**
 * Lane 2 (#1605): availability-lifecycle smoke -- the latch class
 * (#1490/#1494/#1495/#1496/#1537/#1535, #1556-F1).
 *
 * The arc's most recurrent shape: a transient failure gets recorded as
 * durable, latching a tool off for the rest of the session with no path
 * back. Every fix in that family was only ever proven with a MOCKED spawn
 * (`vi.fn()` on `safeSpawnAsync`); this script drives the same production
 * code path (`clients/zizmor-config.ts`'s `resolveZizmorGitHubToken`,
 * built on the shared `clients/dispatch/runners/utils/availability-policy.ts`
 * latch + `clients/degradation-ledger.ts`) against a REAL spawned process.
 *
 * Representative tool: the `gh auth token` probe zizmor's online-mode
 * resolver runs (#1535). Chosen over a plain "rename a linter binary"
 * scenario because a missing-binary ("missing"/"not-found") verdict is
 * DELIBERATELY session-durable by design (`isLatchingOutcome` -- see
 * `availability-policy.ts`) and only re-arms at `session_start`, not on a
 * cooldown; #1605's "restore -> advance past cooldown -> assert recovery"
 * wording describes a TRANSIENT verdict instead, and the gh-token probe's
 * timeout/host-stall path is exactly that: `classifyGhTokenFailure` keeps a
 * probe that never got a fair hearing as `transient`, which
 * `TRANSIENT_BASE_COOLDOWN_MS` (30s, capped at the module's own 120s
 * ceiling) genuinely expires.
 *
 * We never touch the real `gh` CLI. A FIXTURE `gh`/`gh.cmd` shim, written by
 * this script into a scratch directory prepended to PATH, shadows it only
 * for this process's children -- the system's real `gh` (if any) is
 * untouched. "Renaming a fixture-installed binary" from the binary's own
 * bin directory is exactly what phase 3 below does.
 *
 * Phases (one process -- the transient latch is meant to survive within a
 * process across a real cooldown, unlike lane 1's session-durable latches):
 *   1. Fixture `gh` HANGS past the probe budget -> `resolveZizmorGitHubToken()`
 *      times out -> assert transient/latched-false decision AND a degradation
 *      recorded via `incrementDegradationCount` (kind "mode-suppression",
 *      subject "zizmor").
 *   2. Immediate second call, still inside the cooldown -> assert it is
 *      served from cache (no new probe) and the SAME degradation entry's
 *      count increments (recordDegradationOnce/incrementDegradationCount
 *      semantics: one visible ledger entry, an accumulating count) --
 *      never a second row.
 *   3. Restore: rename the fixture `gh` away and write a working one that
 *      answers instantly with a fake token. Poll past the real cooldown
 *      (read `TRANSIENT_BASE_COOLDOWN_MS` from the built module rather than
 *      hardcoding it, and keep polling instead of a single fixed sleep, so an
 *      exponential-ladder bump lengthens the wait instead of failing this
 *      phase as "recovery failed").
 *   4. Assert a GENUINE re-probe happened (the fixture token is returned, not
 *      the cached `undefined`) and the decision log shows a fresh
 *      `available`/`success` record with no new degradation.
 *   5. The OTHER latch half this lane's real subject is: a `missing`
 *      ("not-found") verdict is process-lifetime durable by design
 *      (`isLatchingOutcome`) and does NOT expire on any cooldown -- remove
 *      the fixture entirely and confirm the verdict latches, then RESTORE the
 *      fixture (without resetting the latch) and confirm a second call still
 *      returns `undefined` -- the binding check: gh being merely present
 *      again must not be what re-arms it. Only THEN call
 *      `resetZizmorTokenAvailability()` (the real `session_start` reset) and
 *      confirm that is what re-probes and recovers. (Asserting "still
 *      undefined" against an absent gh would be vacuous -- indistinguishable
 *      from a broken latch re-probing and independently getting the same
 *      missing answer.)
 *
 * Usage: node scripts/smoke-availability-lifecycle.mjs
 * Exit codes: 0 pass; 1 an assertion failed (the latch/cooldown defect this
 * lane exists to catch); 2 infra failure (dist build missing, can't write
 * the fixture).
