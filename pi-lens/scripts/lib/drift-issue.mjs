// live `gh` CLI, mirroring scripts/lib/clean-signal.mjs's own testing pattern
// (tests/scripts/clean-signal.test.ts tests the classifier, not the script
// that spawns servers; this tests the issue-body/lookup logic, not the script
// that shells out to `gh`).
//
// The tracking issue is intentionally SINGLE and persistent: a fixed label +
// a fixed title, found by title match among open issues carrying the label —
// never a new issue every night (that would spam), closed automatically once
// a nightly run finds no drift.
