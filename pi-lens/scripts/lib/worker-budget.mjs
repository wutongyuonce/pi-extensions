// #2042. The suite was OOM-killed on ubuntu-latest (exit 137, SIGKILL, zero
// failing assertions). Two host-specific constants were applied unconditionally
// to CI:
//
//   - `maxWorkers` was left undefined on CI, so Vitest resolved it to
//     `availableParallelism() - 1`. That bounds worker COUNT, which is not the
//     axis that grows.
//   - `--max-old-space-size=4096` was tuned on a 32-core / 68 GB dev host, with
//     the comment "4 GB x workers << host RAM". On a shared CI runner that
//     inequality does not hold.
//
// Measured on 2026-08-25 with a per-file `process.resourceUsage().maxRSS` probe
// over all 740 files of the default project. Peak RSS per file: p50 93 MB, p90
// 389 MB, p99 1405 MB, max 2267 MB, and 42 files above 1 GB. That tail is
// NATIVE memory, not V8 heap -- `tree-sitter-imports.test.ts` peaked at 1601 MB
// RSS while reporting 33 MB heapUsed, because tree-sitter wasm grammar compiles
// and @ast-grep/napi arenas live outside V8's accounting. So
// `--max-old-space-size` cannot bound the growing axis, and `maxWorkers` bounds
// the wrong one. Dividing the host's real memory by a measured per-worker peak
// is the lever that fits.
//
// PROVENANCE OF THOSE NUMBERS, because it matters for how much to trust them:
// they were measured on the DEV host (Windows, 16 cores, 15.6 GB), not on the
// runner. The first `[mem-file]` lines from CI show Linux running roughly three
// times leaner on the same files -- `tree-sitter-imports.test.ts` peaks at
// 580 MB there against 1601 MB here, and 7 files clear 512 MB on CI against 42
// clearing 1 GB on the dev host. So WORKER_PEAK_RSS_BUDGET_MB is conservative
// against the profile it actually governs: it reserves more per worker than a
// CI fork needs, which errs toward fewer workers. That is the safe direction,
// but it is an unvalidated constant on Linux, and it should be re-derived from
// accumulated `[mem-file]` data rather than treated as settled.
