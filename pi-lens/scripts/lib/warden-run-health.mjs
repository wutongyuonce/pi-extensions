/**
 * Head run health (#2184): classify what GitHub Actions actually did with a
 * PR's current head commit.
 *
 * The 2026-08-26 Actions degradation stalled the merge train for hours behind
 * two signatures that every existing gate read as "pending forever":
 *
 * - STARVED RUN: the run concludes `failure`/`startup_failure` while no job
 *   ever executed a step. Verified against the real incident run 32986328966
 *   (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`, conclusion `failure`, `run_attempt` 1): six
 *   jobs sat at `status: "queued"` with `steps: []`, and one matrix job read
 *   `status: "completed", conclusion: "skipped"` with `steps: []`. So "every
 *   job is queued" is NOT the signature — a skipped matrix job breaks it. The
 *   discriminating fact is ZERO EXECUTED STEPS across every job of a run that
 *   nonetheless concluded failed. A genuine test failure always has steps.
 *
 * - ABSENT RUN: no run for a tracked workflow exists on the head at all,
 *   minutes after the commit. GitHub dropped the `pull_request` dispatch.
 *
 * - STALLED RUN (#2203): the run EXISTS and never leaves `queued`. Nothing in
 *   the two signatures above bounds how long a non-`completed` run may sit,
 *   so a head with a zombie run classified `runs-in-progress` on every cycle
 *   forever, which reads as healthy waiting. The discriminator is again ZERO
 *   EXECUTED STEPS: a long matrix job is genuinely in progress no matter how
 *   old it is, but a run that has executed nothing after an hour was never
 *   picked up by a runner.
 *
 * Both are shape 11 in AGENTS.md wearing a new coat: an absent or starved
 * required check is not a passing one. The classifier therefore also emits
 * PENDING and UNKNOWN rather than collapsing "nothing yet" and "we could not
 * read it" into a verdict (shape 10: an empty result must distinguish clean
 * from unavailable).
