/**
 * lens_diagnostic_mark — agent-facing disposition operation (#690, unifying
 * #181/#503/#504's discussion into one triage layer).
 *
 * Four dispositions, given the exact filePath/rule/message/line a
 * lens_diagnostics finding was reported with (same fields shown in that
 * tool's output):
 *   false-positive — the rule misfired. Persists project-wide.
 *   suppress       — real finding, deliberate policy not to fix. Writes an
 *                     inline `pi-lens-ignore: <rule>` comment into the source
 *                     (read by clients/dispatch/inline-suppressions.ts) —
 *                     portable and git-visible, not just a store entry.
 *   defer          — fix later. Session-ephemeral; resurfaces on the next
 *                     process run.
 *   flagged        — mark for the agent to fix. Persists until resolved;
 *                     surfaces in lens_diagnostics mode=full as "flagged-to-fix".
 *
 * Anchoring is content-based, never file:line, but the flavor differs by
 * disposition (see clients/diagnostic-dispositions.ts's module doc):
 * false-positive uses a STRICT anchor (rule + normalized message + a hash of
 * the diagnostic's OWN line — a site-specific judgment that should re-fire
 * if the line is rewritten); defer/suppress/flagged use a WEAK anchor (rule +
 * normalized message only — intent-level judgments that must survive edits to
 * the flagged line). Both are the SAME derivation clients/dispatch/
 * dispatcher.ts and lens-diagnostics.ts's mode=full path use when filtering,
 * so a mark made here is honored on the very next dispatch/query.
 *
 * #802: the caller-supplied `line` is NOT trusted as-is anymore — it's the
 * line a (possibly stale) lens_diagnostics call reported, and the file may
 * have moved on since (an earlier edit, a prior suppress in the same batch
 * shifting later lines down). Before writing anything, `verifyLine` below
 * cross-checks it against live per-file diagnostics recorded in
 * clients/widget-state.ts (same tool/rule/normalizedMessage — reusing
 * diagnostic-dispositions.ts's own normalizer so a match here agrees with the
 * anchor derivation) and reanchors to the CURRENT line when it differs. Where
 * widget-state has nothing for this exact finding, a conservative fuzzy
 * fallback accepts the caller's line if it's in-bounds and non-blank, else
 * searches a small window around it for the nearest non-blank line. See
 * verifyLine's doc for the failure-mode contract (false-positive/defer/
 * flagged degrade to today's trust-the-caller behavior on an internal error;
 * suppress never writes at an unverified position).
